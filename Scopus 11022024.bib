	abstract = {Nowadays, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a powerful platform for diversified application development. In traffic areas specifically for the much-anticipated Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), UAVs can coordinate with the ground internet of things infrastructure, such as the Road Side Unit (RSU), to perform 3D data collection and processing, improving traffic safety and transportation efficiency. In ITS, decision-making is crucial and relies heavily on proper and timely processing and transmission of the massive amounts of data generated by ubiquitous sensors, especially in emergency disposal scenarios. In this paper, the latency incurred from RSU-aided data offloading and UAV-aided data relay plays a decisive role, characterized by both the average and risk performance metric, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), for quantifying the risk incurred from the latency violation over a certain threshold in probability. Specifically, the peak Age of Information (AoI) with its distribution is adopted to underlying the CVaR analysis in relay latency. Besides, the matching algorithm to coordinate the mutual transmission between UAVs and RSUs is proposed, achieving low computation complexity and minimum risk for both sides. The system performance is validated through analysis, simulation, and field experiments. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Swarm robots, particularly drone swarms, are commonly used in search and rescue, military, and detection missions. However, due to their limited computing resources, it can be difficult to handle computation-intensive tasks locally. To address this, cloud-based computation offloading is often used, but it may cause latency issues for time-sensitive tasks like object recognition and path planning. Additionally, in environments with no wireless infrastructure, such as disaster areas or battlefields, cloud computing may not be feasible. To solve this problem, this paper proposes integrating Fog Computing with Swarm of Drones architecture. The paper also formulates the problem as a task allocation problem that minimizes energy consumption while accounting for latency and reliability constraints. To improve swarm autonomy, an integrated framework is proposed, and a testbed development is introduced to support this architecture. The paper reviews existing literature on UAV swarm and proposes a new architecture to enhance swarm autonomy. © Author(s) 2023. CC BY 4.0 License.},

	abstract = {Objective Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shows extraordinary superiority on the battlefield with high mobility, low cost, no casualties, and other advantages, which has changed the form of modern war and made unmanned intelligent war mainstream. For example, using UAVs for reconnaissance provides helpful information for commanders on the battlefield, which has excellent intelligence support value and operational command function. It should be noted that high-precision and real-time target localization is a necessary condition for UAV reconnaissance and target strikes. The airborne electro-optical platform is equipped with high-resolution imaging equipment to recognize the target at a long distance so that the ground target can be tracked and measured without entering the target area. However, in the case of limited observation conditions, such as large inclination angles and small rendezvous angles, the traditional localization method can no longer meet the accuracy requirement. At present, most of the target localization methods to improve accuracy under limited observation conditions can be divided into two basic types. One is based on image matching, and the other is based on geometry. But under the condition of a large inclination angle, the localization method based on image matching is seriously affected by the perspective transformation. Moreover, the results show that limited observation conditions make the design matrix ill-conditioned, and the condition number of the least square method is very large, which seriously affects the accuracy of the geometric localization method. Therefore, improving the target localization accuracy under limited observation conditions is of great significance. Methods The laser range finder has high measurement accuracy. It is not affected by the limited observation conditions such as a large inclination angle and small rendezvous angle, which makes laser ranging have tremendous application value in the field of ground target localization. In order to improve localization accuracy under limited observation conditions, this paper proposes a global optimization method for ground target localization based on the platform's location and laser ranging. In this method, first, according to the continuous observation data of the static ground target, the weighted error equation in the earth-centered and earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system is established. Second, the nonlinear problem is transformed into the problem of the eigenvector solution. Third, all stationary points are found by enumerating seven eigenvectors. Finally, the actual location of the ground target is calculated according to the actual situation. In fact, the critical point of this method is to transform the nonlinear problem into an eigenvector problem through data centralization, singular value decomposition, and other steps. This not only accurately finds the global optimal solution of the equation without iteration or optimization procedure but also improves the efficiency and stability of ground target localization. Results and Discussions The ground target localization system is mainly composed of an airborne electro-optical platform, integrated global position system (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS), and laser range finder. Furthermore, the platform flies in a circle over the ground target, obtaining the UAV's longitude, latitude, and height in the world geodetic system-1984 coordinate system, as well as the distance between the UAV and the static ground target at different time. The simulation experiment results based on the Monte Carlo method show that the localization accuracy is affected by location error of the airborne electro-optical platform, distance error of laser ranging, and data size of continuous observation (Fig. 5, Fig. 7, and Fig. 8). Furthermore, the flight test results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective under limited observation conditions. The target localization error is less than 30 m when the platform is 5 km away from the target, and the observation angle is 66. 42° . Moreover, the operation time can be controlled within 10 ms when the quantity of continuous observation data is within 300 (Table 3 and Table 4). Conclusions In view of limited observation conditions such as large inclination angles and small rendezvous angles, this paper proposes a global optimization method to improve the accuracy of ground target localization. According to the location information provided by the integrated navigation system and the distance information provided by the laser range finder, the corresponding measurement model and weighted error model are set up. A fast closed-form solution for nonconvex optimization problems is obtained by deriving equivalent eigenvectors. The simulation and flight experiments results show that the proposed method has the advantages of high localization accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness compared with the traditional localization method under limited observation conditions, which is of great significance to the reconnaissance and attack of targets on the battlefield. © 2023 Chinese Optical Society.

	abstract = {In this paper，in view of the fact that the traditional aggregation method cannot solve the problem of parameters variation after long- term operation of wind farms，a detailed equivalent model of Doubly Fed Induction Generators（DFIGs）wind farm and initialization method are developed. The trajectory sensitivity of parameters is analyzed. Parameters identification strategy is proposed that the non-time-varying parameters are fixed as aggregated values，while the Genetic Learning Particle Swarm Optimization（GLPSO）hybrid algorithm is used to identify time- varying parameters based on Phasor Measurement Unit （PMU） data at the common interconnection point of wind farm. The robustness and adaptability of the equivalent model of DFIG wind farm under different wind speeds，wake effects，unknown wind speed，different short-circuit fault locations and voltage sags depth and some DFIGs off-line are analyzed. The simulation results using the Western Electricity Coordinating Council benchmark test system show that the global searching capability to find the optimal solution of the proposed method is much higher than that of canonical particle swarm optimization （PSO）and genetic algorithm（GA）. Further，the maximum deriation between the identification results using the proposed method and the true values is less than 10% with high sensitivity parameters，which is much better than previous state-of-art work. © 2023 Science Press.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about significant transformations in multiple sectors, including healthcare and navigation systems, by offering essential functionalities crucial for their operations. Nevertheless, there is ongoing debate surrounding the unexplored possibilities of the IoT within the energy industry. The requirement to better the performance of distributed energy systems necessitates transitioning from traditional mission-critical electric smart grid systems to digital twin-based IoT frameworks. Energy storage systems (ESSs) used within nano-grids have the potential to enhance energy utilization, fortify resilience, and promote sustainable practices by effectively storing surplus energy. The present study introduces a conceptual framework consisting of two fundamental modules: (1) Power optimization of energy storage systems (ESSs) in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. (2) Task orchestration in IoT-enabled environments using digital twin technology. The optimization of energy storage systems (ESSs) aims to effectively manage surplus ESS energy by employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. This approach is designed to fulfill the energy needs of the ESS itself as well as meet the specific requirements of participating nano-grids. The primary objective of the IoT task orchestration system, which is based on the concept of digital twins, is to enhance the process of peer-to-peer nano-grid energy trading. This is achieved by integrating virtual control mechanisms through orchestration technology combining task generation, device virtualization, task mapping, task scheduling, and task allocation and deployment. The nano-grid energy trading system’s architecture utilizes IoT sensors and Raspberry Pi-based edge technology to enable virtual operation. The evaluation of the proposed study is carried out through the examination of a simulated dataset derived from nano-grid dwellings. This research analyzes the efficacy of optimization approaches in mitigating energy trading costs and optimizing power utilization in energy storage systems (ESSs). The coordination of IoT devices is crucial in improving the system’s overall efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In order to improve the measurement accuracy, stability and efficiency of the existing 3D coordinate positioning technology, a deep-learning-based point-diffraction interferometer for 3D coordinate measurement method was proposed. A deep neural network was designed for coordinate reconstruction of the point-diffraction interference field. The phase difference matrix was used as the input to construct the training dataset, and the coordinates of point-diffraction sources were used as the output to train the neural network model. The well-trained neural network was used to process the measured phase distribution initially and the phase information was converted to the coordinates of point-diffraction sources. According to the obtained coordinates of point-diffraction sources, the initial particles of the particle swarm optimization algorithm were further modified, and then the high-precision three-dimensional coordinate was reconstructed. This neural network provides a feasible method to establish the nonlinear relationship between the phase distribution of the interference field and the coordinates of the point-diffraction sources, and significantly improves the accuracy, stability and measurement efficiency of the 3D coordinate positioning. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, numerical simulation and experimental verification were carried out, and different methods were used for repeated comparison and analysis. The results show that the single measurement time of the proposed method is about 0.05 s, and the experimental accuracy can reach the submicron magnitude. The mean and RMS values of the repeatability experiments are 0.05 μm and 0.05 μm, respectively, which proves the feasibility of the proposed method and its good measurement accuracy and stability.

	abstract = {Path planning and obstacle avoidance in 3D terrain have been identified as a monumental challenge for a UAV in a variety of autonomous missions, such as disaster management, and search and rescue operations. In large terrain areas, it is a key problem for traditional approaches to search within the point-cloud maps to find a global path for a UAV considering the flight safety, maneuverability, weather constraints, and fuel cost. Hence, this paper proposes a trajectory planning technique for global and local path planning of a fixed-wing UAV above 3D terrain under static and dynamic constraints. For global path generation, a novel feature selection-based decision model has been proposed to select the features of a point-cloud map and transform them into the feature set. The feature set is utilized by an A* multi-directional planner with an extensive search area to deliver an optimal global path. The global path is assumed as the UAV's reference waypoints. The motion of the UAV on reference waypoints is simplified with two coordinates (R,d), where R is the cumulative distance covered by the UAV along the reference waypoints and d is its offset distance from the reference line segment in time t. For the local path planning, offset trajectories are generated along with reference waypoints to avoid collisions. Cost functions have been added so that the best global and local path can be chosen, taking into account altitude, weather, and fuel constraints. The simulation results and comparison show that the proposed approach outperforms various other 3D UAV path planning techniques in complex terrain. © 2023},

It focuses specifically on investigating the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with limited sensing capabilities and onboard computational resources to perform visual inspections of apriori unknown fractured and collapsed structures in unfamiliar environments. The proposed approach, referred to as First Look Inspect-Explore (FLIE), employs a flexible bifurcated behavior tree that leverages real-time RGB image and depth cloud data. By employing a recursive and reactive synthesis of safe view pose within the inspection module, FLIE incorporates a novel active visual guidance scheme for identifying previously inspected surfaces. Furthermore, the integration of a tiered hierarchical exploration module with the visual guidance system enables the UAV to navigate towards new and unexplored structures without relying on a map. This decoupling reduces memory overhead and computational effort by eliminating the need to plan based on an incrementally built, error-prone global map. The proposed autonomy is extensively evaluated through simulation and experimental verification under various scenarios and compared against state-of-art approaches, demonstrating its performance and effectiveness. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Load forecasting is a significant element in the energy management system of power systems. Precise load forecasting aids electric utilities to conduct decisions of unit commitment, reduction of spinning reserve capacity, and schedule device maintenance plan. Furthermore, load forecasting contributes to reducing the generation cost, and it is fundamental to the reliability of the power systems. On the other hand, short-term load forecasting is substantial for economic running. The forecasting precision directly affects the reliability, economy running and supplying power quality of the power system. Hence, finding the required load forecasting method to enhance the accuracy is valuable for forecasting precision. This paper proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve working support vector machine (SVM), SVM regression model is derived; also derived SVM with PSO. Support vector machine (SVM) model is adopted with and without PSO based on the historical load data and meteorological data of Tajikistan country, analysis the various factors affecting the forecast. The historical data and the load forecasting factors to be considered are normalized. The two parameters of SVM significantly influenced the model, and therefore it optimized using evolutionary algorithm. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Command and Control (C2) is a broad concept that encompasses the coordination of individuals and organizations towards achieving a goal. However, dynamic and uncertain scenarios, such as military and disaster relief operations, present an inherent challenge to C2 activities. In such situations, plans often need to be changed in the face of unforeseen problems, and even coordination processes may be subject to variation. This dynamism increases the complexity of resource management and requires C2 Agility—i.e., the ability to respond to change in a timely and suitable fashion. Nonetheless, there is a lack of solutions to provide C2 Agility to cope with dynamic contexts. To address this problem, this work proposes a computational model of C2 Agility for a team of autonomous agents. This model describes how to combine reconfiguration of individual team members and of coordination approaches to adapt to context changes. The proposed approach leverages a typed-parameterized extension of a channel system to define the coordinating roles and responsibilities of team members. Each member is modeled as a dynamic software product line, with the inherent ability to reconfigure itself. To assess this model, a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) performing a reconnaissance mission was simulated. The simulation showed that the proposed model was suitable for dealing with dynamic contexts. Particularly, metrics for the agile approach suggest improved system resilience in the face of induced perturbations, compared to non-agile C2. The obtained results with the proposed software-based simulations showed that the proposed model is useful in providing C2 Agility to the studied scenarios, making the behavior of the entities specified in the model capable of dealing with context changes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The development concept of higher education will have a direct impact on the development direction of higher education, because the concept usually reflects people's understanding of the law of higher education, and the current education concept restricts the scale, quality, structure and efficiency of higher education to a certain extent. Throughout the evolution of the world's higher education development concept, it has generally experienced the overall coordination of the economic growth, the internal and external laws, and the people-centered sustainable development. This paper hopes to provide effective help by joint intelligent algorithms. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization algorithm in intelligent optimization algorithm and the FCM algorithm in cluster analysis are studied in depth, and the two are merged together to propose a fuzzy clustering algorithm based on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The main research contents of this thesis include: Firstly, the PSO algorithm is improved, and the random search step levy flights and PSO algorithm are repeatedly called by the iterative mode by introducing the eagle strategy. After improvement, the ESPSO algorithm can achieve a balance between global search and local development, and make the particles have more satisfactory search ability and convergence effect. Then the improved PSO algorithm is integrated into the FCM algorithm to solve the above problems of the FCM clustering algorithm and improve the clustering effect. The experimental results show that the improved espso algorithm and FCM algorithm are suitable for actual data. The simulation results show that the algorithm has better clustering effect than the traditional clustering algorithm. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {The present work describes a laboratory-on-a-drone (Lab-on-a-Drone) developed to perform in situ detection of contaminants in environmental water samples. Toward this goal, the system was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (drone) and remotely controlled via Wi-Fi to acquire a water sample, perform the electrochemical detection step, and then send the voltammetry data to a smartphone. This Lab-on-a-Drone system was also able to recharge its battery using a solar cell, greatly increasing the autonomy of the system, even in the absence of a power line. As a proof of concept, the Lab-on-a-Drone was employed for the detection of Pb2+ in environmental waters, using a simple electrochemical cell containing a miniaturized screen-printed boron-doped diamond electrode (SP-BDDE) as a working electrode, an Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and a graphite ink as a counter electrode. For quantification purposes, analytical curves were constructed covering a concentration range from 1.0 μg L−1 (4.83 nmol L−1) to 80.0 μg L−1 (386.10 nmol L−1), featuring a detection limit of 0.062 μg L−1 (0.30 nmol L−1). The Lab-on-a-Drone was applied to monitor a water reservoir in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Brazil. To evaluate its performance regarding accuracy and precision, a reference method based on inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was applied, and the results obtained by both methods showed no statistical differences (t-test at 95% confidence level, n = 3). These results represent the first demonstration of the capabilities of an adapted UAV for the quantification of electroactive environmental contaminant using voltammetry, with real-time data transmission. Thus, the Lab-on-a-Drone makes it possible to reach difficult-to-access environmental reserves and to monitor potentially polluting activity in distant water bodies. Thus, this tool can be used by governments and non-profit organizations to monitor environmental waters using fast, low-cost, process autonomy with accurate and precise data useful to decision making. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle technology is the most advanced and helpful in almost every area of interest in human work. These devices become autonomous and can fulfil a variety of tasks, from simple imaging and obtaining data to search and rescue operations. The most challenging environment for search and rescue operations is the mountainous area. This article is devoted to the theoretical description and simulation tests of a prototype method of landing the light and the medium-weight UAVs used as supplementary devices for SAR (search and rescue) and HEMS (helicopter emergency medical service) in hard-to-reach mountainous terrains. The autonomous flight of a UAV in mountainous terrain has many specifics, and it is usually performed according to predetermined map points (pins) uploaded directly into the control software of the UAV. It is necessary to characterise each point flown on the chosen flight route line in advance and therefore to know its exact geographical coordinates (longitude, latitude and height of the point above the terrain), and the control system of UAV must react to the change in the weather and other conditions in real time. Usually, it is difficult to make this forecast with sufficient time in advance, mainly when UAVs are used as supplementary devices for the needs of HEMS or MRS (mountain rescue service). The most challenging phase is the final approach and landing of the UAV, especially if a loss of GNSS (global navigation satellite system) signal occurs, like in the determined area of the Little Cold Valley in the Slovak High Tatras—which is infamous for the widespread loss of GNSS signals or communication/controlling connection between the UAV and the pilot-operator at the operational station. To solve the loss of guidance, a new method for guiding and controlling the UAV in its final approach and landing in a determined area is tested. An alternative landing navigation system for UAVs in a specific mountainous environment—the authors’ designed frequency Doppler landing system (FDLS)—is briefly described but thoroughly tested with the help of artificial intelligence. An estimation of dynamic stability is used based on the time recording of the current position of the UAV, with the help of a frequency-modulated or amplitude-modulated signal based on the author’s prototype of a precision landing system designed for mountainous terrain. This solution could overcome the problems of GNSS signal loss. The presented research primarily evaluates the success of the simulation flights for the supplementary UAV. The success of navigating the UAV to land in the mountainous environment at an exact landing point using the navigation signals from the FDLS was evaluated at more than 95%. © 2024 by the authors.},

This paper proposes a data-driven support system for schedule delays of UHV projects. The system is composed of three modules. Firstly, general project schedule routines are interpreted by logistic curves. Classical earned values are measured by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which are used for subjective judgement of project managers. These measures serve as the system input. Then, combined objective schedule delay and subjective severity judgement are analyzed by least square support vector regression. Enhanced particle swarm optimization is applied to determine optimal parameter combinations according to the structure of trained data. Next, delay prediction results combining subjective and objective information are divided into three severity degrees by an enhanced K-means algorithm and finally, integrated prevention measures are raised for project managers. The proposed system is validated by a real case study and results indicate good performance and reliability. The system could be integrated into the daily workflow of project managers and constantly provides references that facilitate efficient schedule management. © 2023},

	abstract = {With the fast development of offshore wind farms as renewable energy sources, maintaining them efficiently and safely becomes necessary. The high costs of operation and maintenance (O&M) are due to the length of turbine downtime and the logistics for human technician transfer. To reduce such costs, we propose a comprehensive multi-robot system that includes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), autonomous surface vessels (ASV), and inspection-and-repair robots (IRR). Our system, which is capable of co-managing the farms with human operators located onshore, brings down costs and significantly reduces the Health and Safety (H&S) risks of O&M by assisting human operators in performing dangerous tasks. In this paper, we focus on using AI temporal planning to coordinate the actions of the different autonomous robots that form the multi-robot system. We devise a new, adaptive planning approach that reduces failures and replanning by performing data-driven goal and domain refinement. Our experiments in both simulated and real-world scenarios prove the effectiveness and robustness of our technique. The success of our system marks the first-step towards a large-scale, multi-robot solution for wind farm O&M.

However, when the required sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective arrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and distributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper introduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of spatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized multi-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability, resilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper understanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing performance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring using real-world data to demonstrate a 46.45% more accurate and 2.88% more efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce resource. © 2023 The Author(s)},

One drawback of getting out of the lab is that realistic tasks involve long distances with limited numbers of robots, leading to sparse and intermittent connectivity. As an example, search and rescue requires robots to coordinate in their search, and relay the information of found targets. The search’s effectiveness is greatly reduced if robots must stay close to maintain connectivity. This paper proposes a decentralized search system that only requires sporadic connectivity and allows information diffusion through the swarm whenever possible. Our robots share and update a distributed belief map, to coordinate the search. Once a target is detected, the robots form a communication relay between a base station and the target’s position.

	abstract = {Emergency resource scheduling is at the heart of the response to an oil spill, as it lays the foundation for all other emergency operations. Extant studies address the dynamicity inherent to these operations primarily by modeling a dynamic network flow with static data, which is not applicable to continuously changing conditions resulting from oil film movement. To enhance the responsiveness and cost-efficiency of the response to oil spills, this paper takes a novel approach and formulates a multi-objective location-routing model for multi-resource collaborative scheduling, namely, harnessing time-varying parameters rather than static data to model real-time changes in the demand for emergency resources and the transportation network. Additionally, the model considers various operational factors, including the transportation of multiple resources in the order of operating procedures; the coordination of split delivery with the consumption of emergency resources; and the matching of multiple resources with suitable vehicles. To solve the proposed model, a hybrid heuristic algorithm of PSO-PGSA is developed, which utilizes particle swarm optimization (PSO) to search widely for non-dominated solutions. The algorithm then makes use of the plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA) to find the more effective vehicle routes based on the obtained solutions. Finally, a numerical analysis is used to illustrate the practical capabilities of the developed model and solution strategies. Most significantly, our work not only validates the methodology proposed here but also underlines the importance of incorporating the features of an oil spill emergency response into emergency logistics in general. © 2023.

	abstract = {When acting as dynamic receivers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have several advantages over the conventional static base stations for received signal strength (RSS) based target searching. It is highly likely that the RSS is becoming stronger as the UAV is moving towards the estimated coordinate, and this leads to a higher estimation precision for each localization update. On the other hand, despite its low cost, low energy consumption and simple hardware requirement, RSS can be severely influenced by land layouts, therefore the assumption of a simple free space propagation model may lead to poor estimation precision and even failure, especially for an area where the topography is highly complex. In this paper, we propose multi-UAV target searching with the assistance of radio maps, which contain abundant information of the topography influence on RSS. We generate radio maps from real topographic data, and derive the minimum mean square error estimator for multi-UAV target searching with the radio map knowledge for memoryless observations.

	abstract = {Due to the breakthrough of wireless power transfer technology, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) have the potential to provide sustainable work. Most existing researches on WRSNs usually focus on the cases that mobile charging vehicle moves freely through the sensors. However, for some applications, such as bridge monitoring, WRSNs are implemented in a three-dimensional space with obstacles, so the charging path may be blocked by the obstacles. To cope with this problem, charging scheduling to replenish a wireless rechargeable sensor network for bridge monitoring by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is studied. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem through optimizing UAV navigation path and sensor energy allocation collaboratively. This optimization problem is hard to be solved as both path navigation and energy allocation are required to be optimized simultaneously. To circumvent this challenge, an improved ant colony system algorithm (IM-ACS) is proposed to plan the trajectory of the UAV between sensors. By integrating enhancement factors and dynamic pheromone intensity coefficients, the convergence of the algorithm is accelerated. Then, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to schedule charging sequence and assign energy with limited energy carried by the UAV in each charging period. Experiments and simulations show that the proposed approach achieves shorter feasible trajectory paths and longer network lifetime than those obtained by the compared methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this work, a relay-based UAV-assisted cooperative communication for emergency applications is proposed for rural and semi-urban scenarios. 3-D deployment of multiple UAVs is resolved by jointly optimizing the height and transmit power of cluster UAVs and the optimal trajectory of relay UAVs is perfected by using the graph theory approach. While the majority of works in literature use UAVs as aerial base stations or as relays, this paper proposes to use UAVs as both relays and aerial base stations. Furthermore, this is one of the few works where UAVs are used as both static base stations (cluster UAVs) and mobile base stations (relay UAVs). The proposed 3-D deployment and trajectory planning algorithm is implemented at the ground base station (GBS) and the resultant parameters will be distributed to cluster UAVs either directly or through relay UAVs. A four-step approach is proposed to solve the 2-D location coordinates of cluster UAVs, to find the location of the GBS, the power-height optimization of cluster UAVs, and to optimize the trajectory of relay UAVs. The number of users served, channel capacity achieved, power saved due to optimal deployment, latency reduced, and power saving by optimal trajectory are some of the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The simulation results are validated to show that the proposed solutions outperform existing similar approaches.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The medium-depth geothermal cascade utilization technology plays a crucial role in achieving low-carbon and low-cost heat supply. However, the traditional rigid regulation method faces challenges in ensuring real-time supply-demand balance due to the district heating demand being influenced by outdoor weather and the complexity of the operating parameters of the medium-depth geothermal cascade heating system. Consequently, problems such as low utilization of geothermal water and high operating costs arise. To address these issues, this study proposes a day-ahead scheduling optimization method for the medium-depth geothermal cascade heating system, integrating the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) prediction algorithm, interior point method, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Based on enhanced precision prediction, this study aims to optimize variables including partial load rate (PLR), flow rate, cooling water return temperature, and chilled water return temperature. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization method is verified through the establishment of a TRNSYS simulation platform in conjunction with MATLAB, focusing on a geothermal cascade heating project in Tianjin. The results demonstrate that the proposed day-ahead scheduling optimization method effectively promotes the coordinated operation among energy systems, achieving significant energy savings for the energy station (10.13 %). The novelty of this research lies in the utilization of scientific algorithms to optimize multiple variables within the system, which holds the potential to enhance the matching of supply and demand and improve the operational effectiveness of comparable systems. In summary, this study provides valuable insights and practical implications for the field of strategic optimization. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the applicability of the findings to other geographic locations, different scale projects, or varying system configurations necessitates additional investigation. The generalizability is subject to further research and exploration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

These aerial vehicles require energy for communication and are typically energy constrained. The communication system becomes more energy hungry when it comes to video streaming of high quality. Because for higher video quality streaming, higher bitrate and more bandwidth is required. Higher transmission power and rate will result in increased streaming quality. We concentrate on UAV-aided power efficient adaptive video streaming wireless networks with multiple ground users, taking into account the available energy budget and information causality constraints. The objective of this research work is to maximize adaptive video streaming utility per unit of power in a UAV-enabled wireless communication network by optimizing the position of UAV and allocation of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power, while competing with system-designed constraints, such as energy budget, transmission rate, and allocated bandwidth. The problem that is addressed is non-convex which is approached by applying successive convex approximation, Dinkelbach method and coordinates decent techniques, and an efficient iterative algorithm is devised for its solution. Extensive simulations show that the suggested optimization strategy outperforms the results of the previously proposed works. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Owing to the complexity of the ocean environment, the optimization of SIPS comprehensive performance remains challenging. This article proposes a multiobjective energy management strategy of multiple PPLs in SIPSs. A multiobjective energy coordination model is formulated. By identifying typical operation modes of the SIPS based on discrepant priority, the PPL utility and maneuverability are incorporated into the comprehensive regulation objective in the form of a weighted sum. In the case of limited energy supply, the service duration is further considered in the optimization objective to meet the high survivability requirements. Reasonable methods are adopted to quantitatively evaluate different performances. Moreover, to improve SIPS survivability in the face of emergencies, a system-level energy allocation scheme with maneuverability enhancement is formulated to coordinate the power consumption of different functions. A particle swarm optimization algorithm with directional guidance and selective evaluation of the nonconvex constraint is proposed to solve the optimization problem effectively. Case studies on a typical SIPS under various working scenarios are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) with perpetual network lifetime have been used in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, like oceanic monitoring and precision agriculture. Rechargeable sensors, together with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), are collaboratively employed for fulfilling periodic coverage missions. However, traditional coverage solutions are normally based on static deployment of sensors and not suitable for such novel coverage requirements. In this paper, we propose the concept of Period-Area Coverage (PAC) problem, which requires the data of the overall area must be collected/monitored periodically. To solve the PAC problem, we employ a UAV that simultaneously acts as a mobile charger and sensor. It is responsible for charging nearly exhausted sensors and sensing vacant regions to realize complete event monitoring. To maximize the energy efficiency of the UAV, we propose a heuristic hexagon-based scheduling algorithm (HSA) which can also balance energy consumption. Furthermore, we develop an emergent node charging scheduling method to prevent node exhaustion, and introduce a grid-based boustrophedon scheduling algorithm (GBSA) to reduce the complexity. Finally, we present a charging re-allocation mechanism to further enhance energy efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes can solve the PAC problem and enhance energy efficiency by at least 18.2% compared to prior arts. Test-bed experiments conducted both in agriculture and oceanic monitoring applications validate the applicability of the proposed scheme in practical scenarios.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Utilizing the optical characteristics of the target for detection and localization does not require actively emitting signals and has the advantage of strong concealment. Once the optoelectronic platform mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detects the target, the vector pointing to the target in the camera coordinate system can estimate the angle of arrival (AOA) of the target relative to the UAV in the Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system through a series of rotation transformations. By employing two UAVs and the corresponding AOA measurements, passive localization of an unknown target is possible. To achieve high-precision target localization, this paper investigates the following three aspects. Firstly, two error transfer models are established to estimate the noise distributions of the AOA and the UAV position in the ECEF coordinate system. Next, to reduce estimation errors, a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is designed. Theoretical analysis proves that the mean squared error (MSE) of the target position estimation can reach the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) under the condition of small noise. Finally, we study the optimal placement problem of two coplanar UAVs relative to the target based on the D-optimality criterion and provide explicit conclusions. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the localization method. © 2023 by the authors.},

Specifically, the proposed strategy is supposed to provide electric bus systems with cost-effectiveness. To demonstrate a case study, the existing electric bus system of Khon Kaen University is selected as a model for our investment analysis. The investment cost consists of two significant costs: the investment cost of charging station infrastructure and the investment cost of onboard batteries. The proposed design aims to optimize these costs based on two key parameters: the conditional boundary state of charge (SOCch) and the charging time (Tch). To achieve the optimal solution, we utilize a Differential Evolution Algorithm (DE) for cost optimization, comparing the results to those obtained through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results indicate that our DE-based approach can reduce 14.54% of the total investment cost of the electric bus system compared to the results of PSO approach. Moreover, the designed charging waiting time can provide an efficient bus schedule that accurately reflects actual service periods. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed strategy can effectively promote the adoption of electric bus systems as a more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable transportation option. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The problem of high water consumption and pollution emission of modern coal chemical industry have received widespread attention in recent years. However, while protecting the environment, the economic interests of coal chemical enterprises also need to be guaranteed. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an equilibrium strategy based on a bi-level multi-objectives model to assist decision-makers in coal chemical industrial parks in making plans for infrastructure investment, wastewater discharge load allocation, and production activities while balancing economic benefits, ecological protection, and energy efficiency promotion. The decision framework describes the hierarchical relationship between the park authority and individual coal chemical companies, and coordinates the conflicts between their different goals. Then, a real case study of Yushen coal chemical industrial park in Shaanxi province, China is presented using a hybrid algorithm named “particle swarm optimization - non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - II (PSO-NSGA-II)” to solve multi-objectives programming. The research further discusses the final solutions under different preferences of decision-makers with the Subtractive clustering - Multi-criteria tournament decision - Gain analysis method (SC-MTD-GAM), and also compares the results of a single-objective optimization model and multi-objective programming. The results show that the equilibrium strategy of this research can provide a satisfactory consequence for coal chemical industrial parks in terms of integrative management involving the economy, environment and efficiency. Finally, based on a comprehensive discussion, management suggestions are given to help the related decision/policy-makers to develop sustainable management mechanisms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {UAV-assisted base stations (UAV-BSs) to provide wireless access for terrestrial users is an alternative solution in emergency communication and disaster scenarios. Multi-UAV-BS networks have greater coverage and flexible networking capability, but face problems such as frequency resource conflicts, inter-base station relay links and deployment costs. It is an open topic for discussion whether multi-UAV-BS networks can adopt the cellular architecture applied in terrestrial base station networks. Due to the mobile deployment of UAV-BSs, static interference cancellation or coordination methods are not practical in dynamic scenarios, resulting in further deterioration of signal quality for the edge users. In this paper, a new dynamic cellular network framework is developed for UAV-BS networks with frequency reuse. First, the coverage radius of UAV-BS cells is maximized by solving the convex optimization problem. Second, a non-convex optimization model is proposed to minimize the number of UAV-BSs required, and quickly solved based on the movable location candidate set.

In order to enhance the transient stability of the system after the fault, this paper comprehensively considers the active regulation ability of photovoltaic units, and puts forward an emergency coordinated control strategy for a single-ended distribution network with flexible interconnection channel blocking. Firstly, the non-fault channel is overloaded for a short time, then the comprehensive influence of factors such as electrical distance, response time and adjustment cost on the frequency modulation effect of the system is quantitatively evaluated; according to the evaluation results, the photovoltaic and synchronous units are controlled by "control instead of tripping", and finally, the high-frequency tripping is carried out, based on the principle of "photovoltaics first". After the frequency control is completed, the reactive power optimization model of the system is established, and the improved tabu-particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve it, so as to optimize the voltage of the distribution network nodes. Finally, an equivalent simulation model is established to verify the coordinated control strategy.},

The dispatching mode that aims at the lowest operating cost is proposed, taking into consideration the coordination relationship between the scheduling benefit of pumped storage power stations and the total peak-shaving economy of the system and the fluctuation of new energy output. First, taking the constraint of reservoir capacity, the output power, and the daily pumping power of the pumped storage power station into account, a day-ahead generation scheduling model is constructed, with the objective of minimizing costs.

However, ensuring good mechanical behavior during the generation process of free-form surface structures has become a critical problem in the scientific community. Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a widely adopted approach in various fields owing to its numerous advantages, such as geometric accuracy, high-order continuity, high precision, without traditional meshing, and ease of integration with CAD. The presented work adopts the NURBS surfaces to create geometric models, and developes an isogeometric discretization for free-form surfaces by formulating a shell analysis method based on Kirchhoff–Love hypothesis. The structural strain energy and the first natural frequency of the free-form surfaces are selected as the static and dynamic performance evaluation indices. The optimization objectives are to minimize the structural strain energy and maximize the first natural frequency, with the control point coordinates considered as the optimization variable. The double-objective shape optimization of the free-form surface structure is carried out using the particle swarm optimization technique. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are verified through five numerical examples, and the mechanical properties of the optimized structure are substantially improved. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The utilization of cloud computing server farms is developing quickly, and the interest in high-performance computing (HPC), stockpiling, and systems administration assets for business and logical applications is expanding. Virtual machine (VM) coordination includes the immediate migration of VMs running on fewer physical servers, accordingly permitting more workers to be killed or running in low force mode to improve power utilization proficiency, working expense, and CO2 emanations. A significant advance in VM reconciliation is the location of the host over-burden, which endeavors to anticipate whether the physics server will over-subscribe with VMs. For overloaded detection, in this paper optimized support vector regression (OSVR) model is proposed. Here, to enhance the performance of support vector regression (SVR), the parameters of SVR are optimally selected by using the Oppositional Beetle Swarm Optimization (OBSO) algorithm. After the overloaded detection, the virtual machines are migrated. However, during migration, the system integrity and confidentiality of data may be affected. To avoid the problem, before migration, the data are encrypted using Cyclic Shift Transposition Algorithm (CSTA). The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed in terms of different measures and effectiveness compared with different methods. The results shows that our proposed approach attained the minimum migration and energy consumption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Wireless communication highly depends on the cellular ground base station (GBS). A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or man-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas. In such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save the national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the PSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services in the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible, mobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted PSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's ground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV. The objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the video streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by optimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the distribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power, while satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate, rate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To this end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is mathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge for a solution. Considering the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed. Finally, simulation results are provided which show that our proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, intelligent unmanned systems such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and unmanned boats have played a significant role in various fields, including military, industrial and agricultural production, and logistics transportation. However, due to the limitations in resources and capabilities of individual intelligent unmanned systems, they are unable to meet the increasingly complex demands of real-world applications, it has become a trend to organize multiple intelligent unmanned systems into clusters to achieve collaborative work and swarm intelligence, of which swarm navigation and positioning is an important basis for swarm intelligence. Traditional satellite navigation systems are inadequate to meet the application requirements of intelligent unmanned systems in complex environments. Therefore, autonomous navigation of intelligent unmanned swarm systems has become an urgent problem to solve. Inspired by the neural mechanisms and principles of animal navigation systems and collective coordination, brain-inspired swarm navigation has emerged as a promising research field. It aims to achieve efficient and intelligent navigation in complex and unknown environments, fulfilling the navigation needs of intelligent unmanned systems operating in groups. This article provides an overview of the concept and mechanisms of brain-inspired swarm navigation. It explores the spatial neural mechanisms involved in brain-inspired swarm navigation, relevant simulation models, and swarm intelligence algorithms for brain-inspired swarm decision-making.

	abstract = {The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) system is a set of services offering an automated management of the airspace and thus providing safe and secure Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights in both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Controlled airspace refers to the portion of the airspace that is under the authority of Air Traffic Control (ATC) and where separation services are offered, while uncontrolled airspace refers to the portion of airspace where aircraft are not regulated by ATC. This article is a comprehensive survey of the existing UTMs development efforts with a focus on the different UTMs architectures, the provided services, the used communication technologies and the decision-making process within UTMs. We firstly review the different UTM architecture and propose a novel UTM taxonomy based on high-level qualitative criteria. Secondly, we detail the services provided by UTMs with an emphasis on the used technologies in the identification, the surveillance, the monitoring, and the deconfliction services. Effective decision-making is crucial, particularly in emergency scenarios such as Air-to-Ground (A2G) communication loss, battery or motor malfunction, or encountering aerial obstacles, among other potential hazards. Despite its significance, the UTM decision-making process is not enough considered in the literature and especially in UTM surveys. We analyze and compare in this article both the centralized and decentralized UTM decision-making. Centralized decision-making is not conducted in real-time and primarily relies on Air-to-Ground (A2G) communication. In the decentralized case, the decision-making process primarily relies on communication and collaboration among UAVs with varying degrees of autonomy. We show in this paper that centralized decision-making may encounter issues with packet loss and imperfect data, which can negatively impact the quality of decision-making. We also highlight that the decentralized decision-making may also face challenges related to security and scalability, which can hinder its effectiveness. Finally, evaluating the performance of UTMs on a real environment raises several challenges and the simulation is a cost-effective alternative. Hence, we provide a summary of the existing UTMs simulators and discuss their main features. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is a promising solution for providing high-quality mobile services (e.g., edge computing, fast Internet connection, and local caching) to ground users, where a UAV with limited service coverage travels among multiple geographical user locations (e.g., hotspots) for servicing their demands locally. How to dynamically determine a UAV swarm's cooperative path planning to best meet many users' spatio-temporally distributed demands is an important question but is unaddressed in the literature. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to design and analyze cooperative path planning algorithms of a large UAV swarm for optimally servicing many spatial locations, where ground users' demands are released dynamically in the long time horizon. Regarding a single UAV's path planning design, we manage to substantially simplify the traditional dynamic program and propose an optimal algorithm of low computation complexity, which is only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of spatial locations and user demands. After coordinating a large number K K of UAVs, this simplified dynamic optimization problem becomes intractable and we alternatively present a fast iterative cooperation algorithm with provable approximation ratio 1-(1-1K)K1-(1-1K)K in the worst case, which is proved to obviously outperform the traditional approach of partitioning UAVs to serve different location clusters separately. To relax UAVs' battery capacity limit for sustainable service provisioning, we further allow UAVs to travel to charging stations in the mean time and thus jointly design UAVs' path planning over users' locations and charging stations. Despite of the problem difficulty, for the optimal solution, we successfully transform the problem to an integer linear program by creating novel directed acyclic graph of the UAV-state transition diagram, and propose an iterative algorithm with constant approximation ratio. Finally, we validate the theoretical results by extensive simulations.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

However, the utilization of UAV swarms in sustainable transportation also presents some challenges, such as inefficient task allocation and data transmission security issues, highlighting the importance of privacy protection in this context. To address these issues, this study applies blockchain technology to multi-UAV tasks and proposes a blockchain-based multi-UAV task processing system for situation awareness and real-time decisions. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of UAV swarm task scheduling, bolster data transmission security, and address privacy protection concerns. Utilizing the highly secure features of blockchain technology, the system constructs a distributed task processing network. System tasks are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts, ensuring the immutability and verifiability of task information. Smart contracts have an automatic execution capability, whereby the system can efficiently coordinate tasks and maintain the consistency of task execution information through consensus mechanisms. Additionally, adopting the Pointer Network structure for intelligent path planning based on task allocation results leads to the attainment of the shortest service routes, consequently expanding the service coverage of sustainable transportation systems while reducing energy consumption. This further advances the realization of urban sustainable transportation. Through experimental results, we verify that the proposed system enables real-time task scheduling and collaborative processing for multiple UAVs, significantly enhancing the efficiency, security, and privacy protection level of UAV swarm task execution in the context of sustainable transportation. It makes a positive contribution to building more sustainable urban transportation systems. © 2023 by the authors.},

In order to solve the problems of large model size with slow detection speed that lead to the inability to process images in real time, this paper proposes a lightweight target detector CURI-YOLOv7 based on YOLOv7tiny which is suitable for individual citrus tree detection from UAV remote sensing imagery. This paper augmented the dataset with morphological changes and Mosica with Mixup. A backbone based on depthwise separable convolution and the MobileOne-block module was designed to replace the backbone of YOLOv7tiny. SPPF (spatial pyramid pooling fast) was used to replace the original spatial pyramid pooling structure. Additionally, we redesigned the neck by adding GSConv and depth-separable convolution and deleted its input layer from the backbone with a size of (80, 80) and its output layer from the head with a size of (80, 80). A new ELAN structure was designed, and the redundant convolutional layers were deleted. The experimental results show that the GFLOPs = 1.976, the parameters = 1.018 M, the weights = 3.98 MB, and the mAP = 90.34% for CURI-YOLOv7 in the UAV remote sensing imagery of the citrus trees dataset. The detection speed of a single image is 128.83 on computer and 27.01 on embedded devices. Therefore, the CURI-YOLOv7 model can basically achieve the function of individual tree detection in UAV remote sensing imagery on embedded devices. This forms a foundation for the subsequent UAV real-time identification of the citrus tree with its geographic coordinates positioning, which is conducive to the study of precise agricultural management of citrus orchards. © 2023 by the authors.},

This paper proposes an effective method for simultaneously optimizing different types of energy infrastructure in an environment with various uncertainties while considering grid constraints. To address the multi-energy synergy supply optimization problem in the micro energy grid, a coordinated two-stage programming approach is also suggested. A day-ahead and real-time phases are separated in the scheduling cycle to overcome the effects of the unpredictability of wind energy and solar power. The findings of the day-ahead forecast are then taken into account as uncertain variables for the higher-layer model. The demand response programming model and the energy storage revision model are lower-layer models considering the actual value as the realization of uncertain variables. The competitive swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the problem mentioned above The Cumulative search optimization (CSO) uses global and local systems in particle swarm optimization and adopts a novel learning mechanism for creating competition between particle pairs. Comprehensive numeric examinations show that convergence speed and precision are critical, especially in solving large-scale problems. Therefore, we use chaos theory to improve its performance. Finally, the proposed method is tested and discussed on a system. The results showed that: (1) power-to-gas could convert extra electricity into natural gas; (2) the proposed two-stage optimization model and algorithm achieved different energy optimizations; (3) price-based demand response (DR) can level the energy load curve and maximize multi energy grid (MEG) revenue by using complementary specifications of energy price; and (4) the micro energy grid could communicate with the high-degree energy grid in order to gain more economic benefits. Accordingly, the incentive-based demand response (IBDR) output is reduced. The electricity and heating provided by convention gas turbine (CGT) is increased, which is fed to upper power grid (UPG) and upper heating grid (UHG). Since MEG's purchasing power from UPG during the peak period generates more total revenue than island operations. Based on the obtained results, it can be seen that the proposed algorithm was about 50% faster compared to other methods and its standard deviation was about 0.0013 with different implementations, which was much better compared to other models. © 2023},

	abstract = {The volatility and uncertainty introduced by increasingly integrated renewable energy pose challenges to the reliable and stable operation of the power system. To mitigate the operation risks, a two-stage optimal preventive control model that incorporates transient stability constraints and considers uncertainties from multiple resources is proposed. First, the uncertainties of different re-sources are modeled, with which the non-sequential Monte Carlo sampling method is used to correspondingly generate the scenarios. Thereafter, a two-stage control model that balances operational safety and economy and realizes preventive control and emergency control is built. The operation schedule from the preventive control stage aims to minimize the transient stability probability and operation costs. If any faults destabilize the system, the emergency control stage will be activated immediately to help the system recover stability with minimal control costs. To expedite the solving of the two-stage model, a multi-objective particle swarm algorithm based on entropy-TOPSIS is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and solving algorithm are validated with the modified IEEE118 node system. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The universalization of electricity still presents significant obstacles to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There are still many remote areas, such as oceanic islands and isolated communities disconnected from the grid, that depend on fossil fuels to make it viable. Fernando de Noronha, a tropical oceanic island in Brazil, is a typical case where replacing the diesel-based power plant for renewable energy is imperative, therefore, it served as a testbed for this investigation. This paper presents the implementation and results of a low-cost framework for assessing the photovoltaic potential of rooftops. Using a real case study, the objective is to explore how effective rooftop photovoltaic systems could be on Fernando de Noronha Island by applying low-cost aerophotogrammetry, geospatial analysis and scenario creation. The first approach was mapping buildings, open spaces and solar obstacles using unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey that delivered high-quality digital elevation surface. The 3D rooftop surfaces fed the solar irradiation models and enabled to compute the photovoltaic potential of suitable rooftops. Findings show that 83.3% of the total building rooftop area was deemed economically viable for photovoltaic installations. Furthermore, 80.0% and 60.0% of the rooftops receive annual irradiation levels >1600 kWh/m2 and 2000 kWh/m2, respectively, indicating high potential for exploiting solar resources on decentralized, highly irradiated rooftops. The scenario with the highest photovoltaic potential is three times higher than the lowest. The results indicate that the suitability of rooftops for various photovoltaic system sizes offers the possibility of deploying a combination of smaller and larger urban photovoltaic installations. Furthermore, the decentralized photovoltaic rooftops can compensate for between 66 and 199% of the estimated annual consumption of 31 GWh in 2031. The method is highly transferrable and limited solely by the availability of sources of geospatial data and coordination with stakeholders. The investigation meets the needs of the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy, therefore meeting the environmental needs of the energy sector by promoting renewable energy for the island which is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site and Brazilian National Marine Park and Environmental Protected Area. The investigation demonstrated that creating photovoltaic potential scenarios that nurture informed decision-making processes is a crucial initial step in urban renewable energy planning. The pioneering 2000-ha unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey proved to be a cost-efficient method for producing accurate data for modeling the irradiation and photovoltaic potential in urban areas. The investigation fills the literature gap on modeling photovoltaic potential for remote islands by blending unmanned aerial vehicles and geospatial tools. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The effects of the wind farm on the low-frequency oscillations of interconnected power systems have become a significant problem with extensive apprehension. These low-frequency oscillations are undesirable, malfunctioning and resulting in system instability. This paper studies the influence of various factors on stability, with varying wind penetration, a different combination of controllers, wind farm (WF) integration and replacement of synchronous generators. To enhance the stability, it is integrated and analyzed significance of the controller by considering the power oscillation damper for WF, power system stabilizer for synchronous generators and supplementary controller of flexible AC transmission system devices for the system. The rotor speed deviation is considered an objective function with various constraints for particle swarm optimization to provide the controller's optimized value and combination. The small-signal and transient stability problems were examined using eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulation. The state-space formulation is derived for eigenvalue analysis for small signal stability assessment with system variables. The nonlinear dynamic simulation results for transient stability analysis are obtained using a three-phase fault. From stability analysis, coordinated controllers intensify the capability of SGs and WF under extreme disturbances. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches have been verified using the IEEE-9 bus test system.

	abstract = {Drone delivery is a fast delivery mode that has gained tremendous attention from academia and various companies in recent years. However, due to limited battery and payload capacities which may reduce the system's efficiency, it is better to coordinate ground vehicles and drones to take advantage of both trucks' large capacity and the drone's high speed. As a restriction for realistic parcel delivery systems, customer presence is only sometimes deterministic. For instance, a customer makes an order from an e-retailer, but due to various probable reasons, he cannot be present at home to get service. In this paper, we have introduced a sustainable hybrid truck-drone delivery model with stochastic customer presence. We have modeled the system with the Markov chain and proposed a linear mathematical model. This work processes with a heuristic and a Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Also, we have carried out numerous computational experiments to evaluate the proposed solution methods' performance, where the results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on a case study and studied various aspects of the problem. The results highlight that truck and drone coordination reduces completion time, operational costs, truck emissions, and social penalties. © 2023},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of shallow underground temperature is of great significance for reducing investment risks and promoting the development and utilization of shallow geothermal energy. In this study, a hybrid model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and extreme gradient boosting (PSO - XGB) was developed and compared with single models including K-nearest neighbors (KNN) , support vector regression (SVR) , random forest (RF) , and extreme gradient boosting(XGB). Firstly, 54 sets of borehole data were collected, and the dataset was expanded using Kriging interpolation. Latitude and longitude coordinates, annual average rainfall, annual average temperature, and distance to faults were used as input features for predicting the temperature at a depth of 100 meters underground. Then the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and mean squared error. The results showed that the PSO - XGB hybrid model outperformed the single models in terms of predictive performance. The ERMS is 0.070 6, the EMA is 0.054 9, thei?2 is 0.962 0, and the EMS is 0.005 0, which is significantly higher than the other models in terms of precision and degree of fitting. Therefore, the PSO-XGB hybrid model is superior to the single model in prediction performance. © 2023 Jilin University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study addresses dynamic task allocation challenges in coordinated surveillance involving multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A significant concern is the increased UAV flight distance resulting from the assignment of new missions, leading to decreased reconnaissance efficiency. To tackle this issue, we introduce a collaborative multi-target and multi-UAV reconnaissance scheme. Initially, the multitasking constrained multi-objective optimization framework (MTCOM) is employed to optimize task allocation and reconnaissance time in static scenarios. Subsequently, in case of emergency, we iteratively refine the outcomes of static task allocation through an enhanced auction-based distributed algorithm, effectively reducing UAV flight costs in response to new missions, UAV withdrawal, or damage. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed multi-UAV and multi-target cooperative reconnaissance scheme in resolving dynamic task allocation issues. Additionally, our approach achieves a 5.4% reduction in UAV flight distance compared to traditional allocation methods. The main contribution of this paper is to consider a dynamic scenario model involving UAV damage and the emergence of new reconnaissance areas. Then we propose an innovative collaborative multi-target and multi-UAV reconnaissance scheme to address this issue and, finally, conduct experimental simulations to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Due to the intermittency of renewable energies, their acceptances in electricity market are lower than fossil energies. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the development resistance through portfolio re-equilibrium. Balance supply and demand in markets involving different stakeholders to optimize return on investment. Compared with the past, this paper proposes an integrated optimization with combined meta-heuristic for wind-solar-hydro system. It investigates to coordinate the interactions of power stations and power grid with their internal conflicts respectively. Specifically, the investment profit, the investment volume and the investment risk are considered as the optimized objectives for wind-solar-hydro system. However, power grid takes operation efficiency, surplus electricity and carbon emissions into account to be the optimal objectives. They are composed to establish a bi-level programming model. Moreover, an improved particle swarm optimization is utilized to deal with the problem-orientated model with NP-hard complexity. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the proposed model, a case of wind-solar-hydro system from Panzhihua located in southwest China is conducted. The results showed that portfolio re-equilibrium strategies had the potential to push forward sustainable development. Secondly, generating capacity was positively affected by the initial investment volume. However, the investment profit did not absolutely rise with the grow of investment risk. Thirdly, profit-oriented strategies were conducive to carbon emissions reduction. But risk-oriented strategies can reduce surplus electricity and increase the stability of electricity purchase schemes. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Hybrid hydrogen-battery (HHB) based energy storage technologies have recently become matters of significant interest to enable sustainable and net zero-emission microgrids characterized with high penetration levels of variable renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar and wind. In this regard, there are multiple objectives and constraints controlling the scheduled decision-making framework that manages these microgrid resources while supplying the demand. As such, this paper introduces an integrated energy management system (IEMS) to concurrently optimize the operation schedule of the HHB storage system and provide demand response (DR) via adequate shifting slots for the elastic loads of a microgrid setup. The proposed IEMS aims to optimally manage the microgrid's energy by minimizing three conflicting objective functions: the electricity and battery degradation costs, customers’ discomfort, and peak-to-average ratio (PAR). The proposed IEMS is developed for microgrids containing a mix of variable RES, an HHB storage system, and a local power consumption considering dynamic grid tariff. The IEMS is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and is solved using a multi-objective artificial hummingbird optimizer (MOAHA). To account for the variability and uncertainty of RES, the proposed IEMS is tested under four scenarios: good, bad, average weather scenarios, and a forecasted weather profile based on a stochastic model of RES. The performance of the proposed IEMS is evaluated via comprehensive comparative analyses with the conventional energy management strategy (CEMS) without and with consideration of the HHB storage system and DR. Moreover, the performance of MOAHA has been assessed versus the state-of-the-art multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO). For the purpose of these comparisons, four quality metrics have been utilized to quantify the benefits of the proposed IEMS: renewable contribution factor (RCF), greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and saving cost (SC). The results show that the proposed IEMS yields better-optimized values that help the microgrid operator identify the sweet spot of the conflicting objectives, where it has increased the customer saving to be (82.95%, 29.65%, 33.33%, and 33.00 %), (73%,23.94%, 25.49%, and 31.65%) and (10.69%,3.62%, 1.59%, and 1.67%) compared to the CEMS without/with including HHB. and IEMS based-MOPSO over the four studied scenarios, respectively. Also, the results show the superiority of the proposed IEMS in improving the identified four quality metrics compared to the CEMS without/with considering HHB storage systems and IEMS-based-MOPSO. Accordingly, integrating HHB and implementing optimized IEMS based-MOAHA with considering the DR approach plays a vital role in providing a profit for the customer, protecting the environment from emissions, and enhancing the system's reliability with considering the weather uncertainty. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Efficient exploration is a critical issue in swarm UAVs with substantial research interest due to its applications in search and rescue missions. In this study, we propose a cooperative exploration approach that uses multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our approach allows UAVs to explore separate areas dynamically, resulting in increased efficiency and decreased redundancy. We use a novel dynamic centroid-based method to partition the 3D working area for each UAV, with each UAV generating new targets in its partitioned area only using the onboard computational resource. To ensure the cooperation and exploration of the unknown, we use a next-best-view (NBV) method based on rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), which generates a tree in the partitioned area until a threshold is reached. We compare this approach with three classical methods using Gazebo simulation, including a Voronoi-based area partition method, a coordination method for reducing scanning repetition between UAVs, and a greedy method that works according to its exploration planner without any interaction. We also conduct practical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In a disaster response management (DRM) scenario, communication and coordination are limited, and absence of related infrastructure hinders situational awareness. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones provide new capabilities for DRM to address these barriers. However, there is a dearth of works that address multiple heterogeneous drones collaboratively working together to form a flying ad-hoc network (FANET) with air-to-air and air-to-ground links that are impacted by: (i) environmental obstacles, (ii) wind, and (iii) limited battery capacities. In this paper, we present a novel environmentally-aware and energy-efficient multi-drone coordination and networking scheme that features a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based location prediction algorithm coupled with a packet forwarding algorithm for drone-to-ground network establishment. We specifically present two novel drone location-based solutions (i.e., heuristic greedy, and learning-based) in our packet forwarding approach to support application requirements. These requirements involve improving connectivity (i.e., optimize packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay) despite environmental obstacles, and improving efficiency (i.e., by lower energy use and time consumption) despite energy constraints. We evaluate our scheme with state-of-the-art networking algorithms in a trace-based DRM FANET simulation testbed featuring rural and metropolitan areas. Results show that our strategy overcomes obstacles and can achieve 81-to-90% of network connectivity performance observed under no obstacle conditions. In the presence of obstacles, our scheme improves the network connectivity performance by 14-to-38% while also providing 23-to-54% of energy savings in rural areas; the same in metropolitan areas achieved an average of 25% gain when compared with baseline obstacle awareness approaches with 15-to-76% of energy savings.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Next-generation Internet-of-Things applications pose challenges for sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, involving large bandwidth, increased network capabilities, and remarkably low latency. The possibility of using ultra-dense connectivity to address the existing problem was previously well-acknowledged. Therefore, placing base stations (BSs) is economically challenging. Drone-based stations can efficiently address Next-generation Internet-of-Things requirements while accelerating growth and expansion. Due to their versatility, they can also manage brief network development or offer on-demand connectivity in emergency scenarios. On the other hand, identifying a drone stations are a complex procedure due to the limited energy supply and rapid signal quality degradation in air-to-ground links. The proposed method uses a two-layer optimizer based on a pre-trained VGG-19 model to overcome these issues. The non-orthogonal multiple access protocol improves network performance. Initially, it uses a powerful two-layer optimizer that employs a population of micro-swarms. Next, it automatically develops a lightweight deep model with a few VGG-19 convolutional filters. Finally, non-orthogonal multiple access is used to schedule radio and power resources to devices, which improves network performance. We specifically examine how three scenarios execute when various Cuckoo Search, Grey Wolf Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization techniques are used. To measure the various methodologies, we also run non-parametric statistical tests, such as the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. The proposed method also evaluates the accuracy level for network performance of DBSs using number of Devices. The proposed method achieves better performance of 98.44% compared with other methods. © 2023 by the authors.},

Flying in a formation has the advantage of having multiple airborne sensors and cameras. However, UAV formations are limited in terms of flight time. In this paper we present a system that is capable of achieving persistent formation flight. The system does not need a central coordination unit and is self-organizing by triggering UAVs on the ground to take-off and join the formation whenever a UAV in the formation is about to run out of battery. The replacement process allows the formation to be kept intact for as long as possible. Onboard each UAV, the flight controller handles the formation-keeping and trajectory following while a higher level multi-agent-coordination unit accesses the flight controller to send commands. The leader-follower formation is designed to be rigid and independent of the number of UAVs present in the formation. A prototype consisting of four simulated UAVs was implemented as a proof of concept, which worked as expected. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with poor survival rates. Factors that may enable survival include cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) initiated by bystanders and early use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). This explorative simulation study was conceptualized to test the feasibility of a semi-autonomously operating drone that delivers an AED to a remote emergency location and its bystander-use. Methods: Ten paramedics and nineteen laypersons were confronted with a manikin simulating an OHCA as single bystanders within a field test located in a mountainous region between Austria and Slovenia. The scenario included a mock-call to the local emergency response center that dispatched a drone towards the caller's GPS coordinates and supported the ongoing CPR. The outcomes were the successful delivery of the AED, the time to the first shock, hands-off times, and the overall performance of the CPR. Results: The AED was delivered by drone and used in all 29 scenarios without serious adverse events. The flight time of the drone was in median 5:20 (range: 1:35–8:19) minutes. The paramedics delivered the first shock after a mean of 12:15 ± 2:03 min and hands-off times were 50 ± 22 s. The laypersons delivered the first shock after 14:04 ± 2:10 min and hands-off times were 2:11 ± 0:39 min. All participants felt confident in the handling of the delivered AED. Conclusion: The delivery and usage of an AED via a semi-autonomously flying drone in a remote region is feasible. This approach can lead to early administration of shocks. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Pest birds are a salient problem in agriculture all around the world due to the damage they can cause to commercial or high-value crops. Recent advancements in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have motivated the use of drones in pest bird deterrence, with promising success already being demonstrated over traditional bird control techniques. This paper presents a novel bird deterrence solution in the form of tethered UAVs, which are attached and arranged in a grid-like fashion across a vineyard property. This strategy aims to bypass the power and endurance limitations of untethered drones while still utilising their dynamism and scaring potential. A simulation model has been designed and developed to assess the feasibility of different UAV arrangements, configurations, and strategies against expected behavioural responses of incoming bird flocks, despite operational and spatial constraints imposed by a tether. Attempts at quantifying bird persistence and relative effort following UAV-induced deterrence are also introduced through a novel bird energy expenditure model. This aims to serve as a proxy for selecting control techniques that reduce future foraging missions. The simulation model successfully isolated candidate configurations, which were able to deter both single and multiple incoming bird flocks using a centralised multi-UAV control strategy. Overall, this study indicates that a grid of autonomous ground-tethered UAV platforms is viable as a bird deterrence solution in agriculture, a novel solution not seen nor dealt with elsewhere to the authors’ knowledge. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {For the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the coverage may be drastically degraded when disasters or breakdowns occur due to the destroyed communication network. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations for IoT emergency coverage is possible because of their agility and low-altitude deployment. With the deployment of UAVs, strong co-channel interference may be formed in the network because of the line-of-sight channels between UAVs and the ground terminals. To address this issue, in this paper, coordinated multi-point (CoMP) technique along with the proper deployment of UAVs is developed in a multi-UAV-assisted IoT network. However, CoMP is difficult to implement for the entire network due to its processing delay and overhead. Therefore, the network is splatted into overlapped clusters by employing a user-centric clustering approach. We aim to minimize the system's energy consumption, including propulsion and communication energy, while optimizing the CoMP clusters and beamforming vectors, as well as the UAVs’ trajectories and velocities. The energy minimization problem is formulated subject to target information rate for IoT users, UAVs’ mobility, and maximum transmit power constraints. Since the formulated problem suffers from nonconvexity, an efficient solution is proposed to deal with it. First, for fixed clusters and beamforming vectors, the UAVs’ trajectories and velocities are optimized. Then, for fixed UAVs’ deployment, we optimize the CoMP clusters and beamforming vectors. Finally, two sub-problems are solved alternatively using an alternating optimization technique. Numerical results verify that the proposed solution is effective. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The cooling water flow and temperature in the heat exchange process outside the engine exhibit dynamic characteristics of nonlinear, time-varying, and solid coupling, precise control algorithms to optimize the coordination mechanism of the pump and valve with electronic control are crucial factors for the cooling system to handle thermal loads. This article presented a feedforward compensation decoupling control and schedules the fuzzy proportional-integral-differential (FPID) controller optimized through an improved particle swarm algorithm for the engine cooling system. Primarily, the mathematical model of the cooling system's heat exchange is constructed by gathering relevant data, and the feedforward compensation decouplers are designed to diminish the coupling extent of cooling water flow and temperature in the external cooling cycle. Next, the whole control system model is created in MATLAB/Simulink and functional simulation is performed by incorporating particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the dynamic adjustment strategy of stochastic inertia weight to optimize the FPID controller's quantization and proportionality factors. Eventually, the approach's feasibility is validated on the existing physical experimental platform. The findings demonstrate that this proposed improved control and optimization method is expected to enhance the water flow regulation characteristics as well as temperature control precision of the cooling water and strengthen the stability of the heat exchange efficiency of the cooling system.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

Specifically, the UAV acts as a base station performs a two-phase task in each time-slot (TS). During the first phase of the TS, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) mode is used to serve multiple mobile users in the downlink. During the second phase, WPT technology is used to charge multiple mobile users on the ground. Due to the limited on-board energy of the UAV, our goal is to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, the information transmit power, the WPT power and the user bandwidth. However, the highly coupled nature of the optimization variables makes the nonconvex problem difficult to solve. In order to solve the problem, a low-complexity alternating iterative optimization algorithm is devised, utilizing block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of precision agriculture technology worldwide, plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in the prevention and control of agricultural pests and diseases due to their advantages such as unrestricted terrain, strong maneuverability, hover capability, and high operational efficiency. In view of the fact that most of the current path planning methods for plant protection UAVs are mainly applicable to large fields with relatively flat terrain, and there is a lack of three-dimensional path planning methods applicable to hilly orchards, as well as a lack of intuitive evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the paths by utilizing the amount of energy consumption, this paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) path planning method for plant protection UAVs in hilly orchards. The method utilizes the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of the operational area obtained from a realistic 3D model of the area, and determines the 3D operational path through the use of Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition and the height variations of the operational area. Based on the induced power used by the plant protection UAV for flight and the power needed to overcome wind resistance, combined with the change of the load of the plant protection UAV and the supply situation, the relative energy consumption model of the plant protection UAV is constructed. Then, by optimizing the operational heading angle (1–180°), the 3D path with the minimum relative energy consumption is obtained. Through a simulation test, it is demonstrated that the path with the minimum relative energy consumption (operational heading angle of 133°) reduces the average relative energy consumption by 62.44% and 47.21% compared to the path with the maximum relative energy consumption (operational heading angle of 51°) and the average relative energy consumption, respectively. This proves the feasibility of the proposed path planning method in hilly orchard environments and provides a reference for the application of plant protection UAVs in such orchards. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle-aided visible light communication (UAV-VLC) can be used to realize joint emergency illumination and communication, but the endurance of UAV is a key limiting factor. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the use of an angle diversity transmitter (ADT) to enhance the energy efficiency of the UAV-VLC system. The ADT is designed with one bottom LED and several evenly distributed inclined side LEDs. By jointly optimizing the inclination angle of the side LEDs in the ADT and the height of the hovering UAV, the study aims to minimize the power consumption of the UAV-VLC system while satisfying the requirements of both illumination and communication. Simulation results show that the energy efficiency of the UAV-VLC system can be greatly enhanced by applying the optimized ADT. Moreover, the energy efficiency enhancement is much more significant when the LEDs in the ADT have a smaller divergence angle, or more side LEDs are configured in the ADT. More specifically, a 50.9% energy efficiency improvement can be achieved by using the optimized ADT in comparison to the conventional non-angle diversity transmitter (NADT). © 2023, 0 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an inevitable choice due to their advantages of flexible movement and rapid deployment for ensuring emergency communication services. The endurance of UAVs may be limited due to the inability to charge in time in emergency communication scenarios. In this paper, we present a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based multi-UAV dispatching mobile edge computing (MEC) offloading for emergency communication networks, where each UAV is equipped with MEC server to provide computing services for terrestrial users, and NOMA technology is used to increase spectrum utilization and reduce task processing energy consumption. The main goal is to maximize the energy efficiency of UAV-MEC systems by jointly optimizing computing resources, power control, and UAV dispatch in this paper. The system energy efficiency (SEE) optimization problem is complex and non-convex, to solve this, we first adopt the Dinkelbach method to transform the original problem into an equivalent problem. Then, we decompose the equivalent problem into a resource allocation subproblem based on a given UAV dispatching strategy and UAV dispatching subproblem for a given resource allocation strategy. To address the resource allocation problem, we derive closed-form solutions for computing resources and power allocation with the Lagrangian dual method. Next, we propose a three-stage UAV energy-efficient dispatching scheme based on the global K-Means (GKM) algorithm to optimize the dispatching of UAVs. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The collaborative deployment of multiple UAVs is a crucial issue in UAV-supported disaster emergency communication networks, as utilizing these UAVs as air base stations can greatly assist in restoring communication networks within disaster-stricken areas. In this paper, the problem of rapid deployment of randomly distributed UAVs in disaster scenarios is studied, and a distributed rapid deployment method for UAVs´ emergency communication network is proposed; this method can cover all target deployment points while maintaining connectivity and provide maximum area coverage for the emergency communication network. To reduce the deployment complexity, we decoupled the three-dimensional UAV deployment problem into two dimensions: vertical and horizontal. For this small-area deployment scenario, a small area UAVs deployment improved-Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (SAIBFGS) algorithm is proposed via improving the Iterative step size and search direction to solve the high computational complexity of the traditional Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. In a large area deployment scenario, aiming at the problem of the premature convergence of the standard genetic algorithm (SGA), the large-area UAVs deployment elitist strategy genetic algorithm (LAESGA) is proposed through the improvement of selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The adaptation function of connectivity and coverage is solved by using SAIBFGS and LAESGA, respectively, in the horizontal dimension to obtain the optimal UAV two-dimensional deployment coordinates. Then, the transmitting power and height of the UAV base station are dynamically adjusted according to the channel characteristics and the discrete coefficients of the ground users to be rescued in different environments, which effectively improves the power consumption efficiency of the UAV base station and increases the usage time of the UAV base station, realizing the energy-saving deployment of the UAV base station. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via data transmission rate simulation results in different environments. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this article, we design a PSC LTE-Advanced air–ground-based HetNet (AG-HetNet) that is a scenario representation of a geographical area during and after a disaster. As part of the AG-HetNet infrastructure, we have UABSs and ground user equipment (GUE) flocking together in clusters at safe places or evacuation shelters. AG-HetNet uses cell range expansion (CRE), intercell interference coordination (ICIC), and 3D beamforming techniques to ensure ubiquitous connectivity. Through system-level simulations and using a brute-force technique, we evaluate the performance of the AG-HetNet in terms of fifth-percentile spectral efficiency (5pSE) and coverage probability. We compare system-wide 5pSE and coverage probability when UABSs are deployed on a hexagonal grid and for different clustering distributions of GUEs. The results show that reduced power subframes (FeICIC) defined in 3GPP Release-11 can provide practical gains in 5pSE and coverage probability than the 3GPP Release-10 with almost blank subframes (eICIC). © 2023 by the author.},

However, with the support of intelligent control methods, the greenhouse energy-saving market with cost reduction and efficiency has gained increasing attention. Therefore, there is a great potential to expand the research on coordinated energy conservation and optimal control of greenhouse environment, with the objective of improving greenhouse yield and reducing production costs. In this study, a phototemperature coupled net photosynthetic rate (Pn) model was established by using the rectangular hyperbolic correction model of temperature correction, and the model parameters were obtained by Nlinfit fitting. Based on the NSGA-II algorithm, the Pareto optimal frontier was obtained with the objective of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing predicted crop yield. The artificial fish swarm algorithm was used to find the maximum point for the three-dimensional interpolation network of the established crop model. Different evaluation strategies were used to evaluate the optimal solution. The results showed that the average power consumption before and after optimization was reduced by 4.31 %, when Pn remained basically unchanged. When the power consumption remained basically unchanged, the average increase in Pn was about 9.59 %. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Diversified applications and scenarios put forward AI-native requirement for communication network. The network is envisioned to offer high data rate and low-latency communications, pervasive artificial intelligence, full coverage and programmable service. With the aid of AI, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an indispensable role in the emerging scenarios. Owing to their flexibility and scalability, UAVs can be utilized as the mobile platform to deliver various kinds of services in dynamic and adversarial environments, especially the emergency scenarios. In this article, we deal with the post-disaster scenarios that UAVs, equipped with computing servers, work with the remaining infrastructures to provide communication and computing services for the ground mobile users (GMUs). With the aim of minimizing the energy cost and computing delay of task offloading, a two-layer optimization mechanism that can dynamically orchestrate the task offloading decision and the UAVs deployment is proposed. In lower layer, the problem of making offloading decisions is formulated into an evolutionary game. Replicator dynamics is exploited to help users to make decisions. In upper layer, a clustering approach for users is introduced to avoid unbalanced load distribution. By suggesting the locations and number of UAVs based the clusters, system cost is further reduced. The fairness of service load among UAVs is also achieved. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer optimization mechanism. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed to provide wireless connectivity to static and mobile ground users in situations of increased network demand or points of failure in existing terrestrial cellular infrastructure. However, UAVs are energy-constrained and experience the challenge of interference from nearby UAV cells sharing the same frequency spectrum, thereby impacting the system's energy efficiency (EE). Recent approaches focus on optimising the system's EE by optimising the trajectory of UAVs serving only static ground users and neglecting mobile users. Several others neglect the impact of interference from nearby UAV cells, assuming an interference-free network environment. Furthermore, some works assume global spatial knowledge of ground users' location via a central controller (CC) that periodically scans the network perimeter and provides real-time updates to the UAVs for decision-making. However, this assumption may be unsuitable in disaster scenarios since it requires significant information exchange between the UAVs and CC. Moreover, it may not be possible to track users' locations in a disaster scenario. Despite growing research interest in decentralised control over centralised UAVs' control, direct collaboration among UAVs to improve coordination while optimising the systems' EE has not been adequately explored. To address this, we propose a direct collaborative communication-enabled multi-agent decentralised double deep Q-network (CMAD–DDQN) approach. The CMAD–DDQN is a collaborative algorithm that allows UAVs to explicitly share their telemetry via existing 3GPP guidelines by communicating with their nearest neighbours. This allows the agent-controlled UAVs to optimise their 3D flight trajectories by filling up knowledge gaps and converging to optimal policies. We account for the mobility of ground users, the UAVs' limited energy budget and interference in the environment. Our approach can maximise the system's EE without hampering performance gains in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in terms of maximising the systems' EE without degrading coverage performance in the network. The CMAD–DDQN approach outperforms the MAD-DDQN that neglects direct collaboration among UAVs, the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and random policy approaches that consider a 2D UAV deployment design while neglecting interference from nearby UAV cells by about 15%, 65% and 85%, respectively. © 2023 The Author(s)},

In this paper, we use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as instantiations of physical agents. MCA is a scalable architecture and aims to provide the UAVs with parallel mission plans, adopting a fire spread probability map and the Fuzzy C-means method to avoid mission overlap and duplicate information. The architecture is then enhanced by integrating a synchronized communication framework to facilitate UAVs' adaptive cooperation and total flight time optimization. Furthermore, integrating the communication framework minimizes the number of deployed UAVs to fully cover the same area, saving considerable cost and energy compared to the Parallel Mode. The scalability challenge of the Parallel Mode, determining the required number of UAVs to cover the entire area, and the efficiency of the mission planning algorithm are thoroughly investigated and compared to the performance of the Communication Mode. Finally, the simulation results prove the MCA's effectiveness in enhancing the UAVs' exploration capability, resulting in comprehensive monitoring of all affected areas. Note to Practitioners-The proposed architecture in this research could offer flexibility to increase the number of UAVs on demand without requiring a change and adjustment of the parameters.

	abstract = {High-voltage direct current (HVDC) blocking disturbance leads to large power losses in the receiving-end power grid, and the event-driven emergency frequency control (EFC) is an important measure to prevent large frequency deviation. By aggregating controllable distributed energy resources (DERs) on the demand side, a virtual power plant (VPP) could quickly reduce its power and can be a new fast response resource for EFC. Considering both the VPP and the traditional control resources, this paper proposes an optimized EFC strategy coordinating multiple resources for the receiving-end power grid with multi-infeed HVDC. The approximate aggregation model of the VPP response process is constructed, based on which the EFC strategy, aiming at minimizing the total control cost while meeting constraints on rotor angle stability and frequency deviation security, is proposed. The electromechanical transient simulation combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized to solve the model, and parallel computation is utilized to accelerate the solving process. The effectiveness of the proposed EFC strategy is verified by a provincial receiving-end power grid with multi-infeed HVDC. The detailed simulation results show that VPP could dramatically reduce the control cost of EFC while maintaining the same stability margin. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face long time consumption and low work efficiency in inspecting fire hazards around transmission lines in mountainous areas and performing early fire extinguishing operations. In order to solve these problems, the existing UAV inspection and fire extinguishing processes were merged and reorganized. Firstly, based on the existing research on UAV inspection and fire extinguishing processes, process program analysis and Petri net model method were adopted, and the processes of UAV inspection and fire extinguishing were analyzed to obtain the corresponding operation process. The correlation matrix and invariant analysis method were used to test the model to ensure its applicability. Then, the two independent steps were unified, and the repeated steps were merged based on the principle of eliminate, combine, rearrange, and simplify (ECRS). The final optimized process scheme was thus obtained. Finally, through the simulation of the same case, the difference between the model before and after the integration optimization was analyzed and calculated. The results show that the optimized scheme based on Petri net can greatly improve the rapid response ability of UAVs for fire extinguishing after receiving the fire source coordinate position information and reduce the repeated operation process and unnecessary time consumption. Compared with that of the traditional operation scheme, the operation time of the optimized process scheme is reduced by 39. 1%, and the handling distance is reduced by 50%. © 2023 China Safety Science Journal.

These aerial vehicles, many of them unmanned vehicles (UAV), will serve a variety of service-related functions: Search and Rescue (SAR), Medivac, delivery and lift operations, aerial mapping, and, of course, human transportation [1]. Despite its numerous functionalities, this type of vehicle has a serious problem, which is its usual batteries, the main means for its operation. Due to its autonomy not being so effective compared to its charging time, generating a considerable loss of time. In this context, it is necessary to find forms of components that can replace these batteries, so that the effective development of these vehicles is possible. Studies done in other means of transportation point out that the use of hydrogen fuel cells has grown a lot. In this way, it is known that this type of fuel is seen as something of the future, but many companies have evaluated the possibility of implementation in cars, trains, and even airplanes. Therefore, a literature review will be presented about this new type of technology, demonstrating its advantages and its use.

	abstract = {In large wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), the limited battery capacity of sensor nodes and finite network lifetime are commonly considered as performance bottlenecks. Previous works have employed wireless mobile vehicles (vehicles) to charge sensor nodes (nodes), but they face limitations in terms of low speed and offroad terrain. The rapid development of wireless charging drones (drones) brings a new perspective on charging nodes; nevertheless, their use is limited by small capacity batteries and cannot cover large regions alone. Most existing works consider the charging of nodes only with vehicles or drones. However, these solutions may not be robust enough, as some nodes’ energy will have run out before vehicles’ or drones’ arrival. Considering the merits and demerits of vehicles and drones comprehensively, we propose a novel WRSN model whose charging system integrates one vehicle, multiple drones and one base station together. Moreover, a charging strategy named long-distance first matching (LDFM) algorithm to schedule the vehicle and multiple drones collaboratively is proposed. In the proposed scheme, drones that are carried by the vehicle start from the base station. According to distance and deadline of nodes with charging requests, LDFM prioritizes nodes with the longest matching distance for allocation to drones. As a result, the proposed scheme aims to minimize the moving distance of charging scheduling of the WCV on premise of satisfying charging requests with the cooperation of WCVs and drones. Our proposed scheme is thus designed to maximize the efficiency of drone usage and shares the charging burden of the vehicle, which makes WRSNs work well in large and complex terrain regions, such as a hill, natural disaster areas or war zones. Simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme outperforms hybrid scheme in previous work with respect to total number of charging nodes and network energy consumption. Especially with heavy traffic load, the proposed scheme can charge more than 10% additional nodes compared to the hybrid. Moreover, the proposed scheme achieves a reduction of over 50% in the moving distance compared to the hybrid. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Plant protection drones can rotate at high speed in the process of droplet spraying. The downwash flow field can be generated by the rotors, leading to droplet drift. A rapid and accurate prediction of the velocity in the downwash flow field under the rotor can greatly contribute to improving the effectiveness of the UAV’s precision application. In this study, a prediction model was constructed in the downwash flow field of the single-rotor plant protection UAV using a physics-informed neural network. The prediction model effectively combined fluid dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI). A neural network model also incorporated into the physical equations. The powerful capabilities of the neural network were combined with the disciplinary context. Firstly, a physical model was used with the Lattice-Boltzmann to numerically simulate the flow field of the single-rotor plant protection UAV. The low-resolution flow field was then used to train the prediction model after numerical simulation. Secondly, the Navier-Stokes equations were embedded as the physics loss term in the prediction model, according to the fully connected neural network structure. The physics equations were utilized in the prediction model to learn the fluid flow patterns in the flow field. The interpretability of the model was enhanced to reduce the data dependence of the network model. Thirdly, the trainable parameters were updated iteratively to minimize the loss function during the training. The loss function was composed of both the physics and data loss terms. The training process was then realized to obtain the mapping relationship between physical quantities (such as velocity information) and space-time coordinates. As such, the mapping relationship was used to realize the fast prediction of the downwash flow field in the single-rotor plant protection UAV. Finally, the wind tunnel experiment was carried out to measure the velocity information of the flow field of the single-rotor plant protection drone under different side wind speed conditions. The accuracy and feasibility of the prediction model were verified to compare the differences between the experimental and predicted data. There was a small difference between the predicted and experimental values without the side wind. The errors between the predicted and experimental values were less than 0.6 m/s at four distances (including 0.3, 0.7, 1.1, and 1.5 m) below the rotor. The relative errors were within 15% at the rest of the locations, except that the low-velocity area was susceptible to external factors (such as ambient wind). The linear regression was performed on the predicted and experimental values in each directional velocity under the different conditions of side wind speed (including 0, 2, 4, and 6 m/s). The expressions of the fitted curves were y=0.949x+0.213 and y=0.942x-0.079, respectively. In conclusion, the prediction model can greatly contribute to determining the downwash flow field in the single-rotor plant protection drone. An effective technical reference can be offered to rapidly and accurately predict the flow of field information. The finding can also provide data support to the influencing mechanism of wind field on the droplet deposition distribution. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and building information modeling (BIM) have been applied to inspect building surfaces to improve efficiency and reduce labor costs. However, most of the current research focus on the inspection mode of “first collect and then identify” with limited intelligence. Therefore, this study proposes a “global-local” adaptive inspection method for building surfaces by integrating BIM, UAV (with multifunction camera), and edge computing, enabling real-time synchronization of crack data collection and analysis. First, the building surface area to be inspected is extracted from BIM to generate global inspection points using the selected camera's field of view (FOV) and considering coordinates transformation between BIM and reality. Then, A star algorithm integrating with genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the global flight path based on generated inspection points. Finally, the coordinates of the inspection points based on BIM are converted into real-world coordinates, and the flight parameters such as the flight yaw angle (FYA) and the gimbal yaw angle (GYA) are calculated to generate the inspection mission. During global inspection, a local adaptive inspection is proposed for each FOV through real-time local crack identification and flight replanning using edge computing and zoom camera. In addition, multiple battery supply points are automatically added considering the endurance of the UAV. A real building has been used to validate the proposed “global-local” adaptive inspection method. The experiment results show that the inspection time has been significantly reduced compared with the traditional method, and the crack identification of building surfaces can be implemented with high efficiency, precision, quality, and low cost. © 2023},

Lack of communication coverage has important implications on outage management, repair crew scheduling, and resilience of power distribution systems. On the other hand, the control center of the distribution system needs a damage assessment to locate damages and schedule the repair crews. However, this information is generally not fully available in the early post-disaster moments. In this paper, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed to provide communication links between repair crews and control center in the crisis area. UAVs also contribute to damage assessment and inspect their perimeter to find any new damages that are still not discovered by assessment crews or consumers’ reports. For this purpose, in this paper, a dynamic algorithm is proposed for scheduling of repair crews, specifying UAVs locations to provide communication coverage for the repair crews as well as UAVs trajectories to vision the perimeter and find new damaged components. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, detailed simulation results are presented for a distribution test system with five available repair crews and three UAVs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, UAVs’ limited onboard energy storage necessitates optimized, energy-efficient communication strategies and intelligent energy expenditure to maximize productivity. This work proposes a novel joint optimization model to coordinate charging operations across multiple UAVs functioning as aerial base stations. The model optimizes charging station assignments and trajectories to maximize UAV flight time and minimize overall energy expenditure. By leveraging both static ground base stations and mobile supercharging stations for opportunistic charging while considering battery chemistry constraints, the mixed integer linear programming approach reduces energy usage by 9.1 ​% versus conventional greedy heuristics. The key results provide insights into separating charging strategies based on UAV mobility patterns, fully utilizing all available infrastructure through balanced distribution, and strategically leveraging existing base stations before deploying dedicated charging assets. Compared to myopic localized decisions, the globally optimized solution extends battery life and enhances productivity. Overall, this work marks a significant advance in UAV energy management by consolidating multiple improvements within a unified coordination framework focused on joint charging optimization across UAV fleets.

This study proposes real-time detection of Cotton Flying Moths (CFMs) with the assistance of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system in the agricultural field. The proposed prototype contains a group of sharp infrared sensors, a Zigbee-based communication module, an Arduino 2560 Mega board, a lithium polymer battery (to power the mote), a gateway device, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to respond as a pesticide-sprayer against the detected pest.

The gateway device sends detection coordinates to the drone/UAV to respond by spraying pesticide in the detection region. A real testbed and simulation scenarios were implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed detection system. The results of the testbed implementation suggest the effectiveness of the sensor design and CFM detection. Initial results from the simulation study indicate the suitability of the proposed prototype deployment in the agricultural field.

	abstract = {The culmination of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Internet of Things (IoT) is being utilized considerably in a wide industrial domain due to the development of 5G technologies. In the UAV-IoT domain, Software-defined networking (SDN) presents viable networking architecture as it decouples the application execution from the data repository. For effective deployment, the SDN network must be divided into numerous domains, each of which is handled by a controller. Moreover, the network topology is shared by all controller nodes, allowing for cross-domain path routing to be implemented. Furthermore, since the coordinates of the UAV are known, any change in the location due to UAV mobility can be detected. It will trigger the sharing of the updated routing tables in the UAV network. However, cross-domain routing necessitates a certain confidence level in controllers. Conspicuously, vulnerable controllers may exchange incorrect typologies with other controllers, causing them to inadvertently cross domain boundaries. In the current paper, a blockchain-inspired framework is proposed to provide safe routing across several applicability domains of UAV-IoT. Using the smart contract, all SDN controllers post abstract typologies to the blockchain. As a result, the blockchain provides a viable scenario for the network because of its consensus and immutability. Additionally, it is utilized to ensure routing dependability and managing global reputation in the blockchain. The proposed model achieved enhanced measures of accuracy (96.58%), precision (96.66%), recall (96.69%), and F1-measure (96.61%). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique can successfully develop trust between numerous controllers and enable safe routing across different domains when compared to benchmark systems in terms of temporal efficacy, stability analysis, reliability analysis, and statistical parameters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {One of the primary challenges for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) developers is to improve their endurance while in the air, as their typical flight time is limited to a few hours. One widely used technology to enhance their endurance is harnessing solar energy to power UAV and charge their batteries in flight. This article presents the development of a real-time simulation environment to enable the continuous flight of the Sky Sailor solar UAV. Through the utilization of a solar irradiance model, a solar panel model, real-time power generation is calculated. Simultaneously, the UAV’s full dynamic model, along with the autopilot and propulsion system model, is employed to determine the energy consumption at each moment. The energy management algorithm then compares the acquired energy with the power consumed, and in cases of surplus energy, it is efficiently stored in the battery for nighttime usage. Simulations show that continuous flight of the drone can be achieved during the summer season, when the daylight hours are long enough to fully charge the battery, With the ability to fly continuously during this period, the UAV can be used in various areas, such as monitoring forest fires, agricultural fields, beaches, and security monitoring for oil companies and their life bases in deserts. © 2023, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.},

	abstract = {Combating Climate Change requires temporally and spatially-resolved atmospheric and solar data planetwide. A method to acquire these essential data provides a rationale to develop and test a safe way to reduce insolation if needed. The Glitter Belt High Altitude Long Endurance architecture of reflective vehicles serves two purposes. Firstly as long-endurance globe-spanning meteorology platforms, and secondly, as a scalable, reversible option to reduce insolation. These vehicles offer unprecedented access for emergency response and remote sensing, planetwide. There are several unique challenges, including 30.5 km cruise altitude, 12-h unpowered night glide requirements, rendezvous and swarm operation for high-precision distributed antenna applications. All are shown to be feasible. Conceptual design, small scale design-build-fly tests, and dynamic flight simulation are used to remove uncertainties and derive system properties. Winds are seen to be within limits that permit the vehicles to achieve desired Peak Summer Follower routes. Scale-up to reduce atmospheric heat retention is viable in concert with GreenHouse Gas (GHG) reduction and measures to improve industrial efficiency. New climate data suggest a clear target and credit equivalence for reducing insolation, equating reduced insolation with Carbon Emission Units (CEU). A schedule is suggested for deployment and removal of reflective platforms. Data suggest an equivalence of 0.11 CEU/m2 of high-altitude reflector. This schedule would bring Earth's Energy Imbalance down to the level of 1990, by year 2055 assuming 2024 start. Spinoffs include a scheme to thicken a sea ice swath bordering Antarctica, and mountain glacier tops. This could control and reduce sea level and aid fresh water security. These are set in a broader international context of supporting Sustainable Development Goals. Given international will, Global Warming can be controlled in a verified, safe and reversible manner that uniquely satisfies all guidance from the National Academies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Extreme natural disasters can seriously disrupt power systems. The increased damage intensity of natural disasters also leads to synchronous failures in communication systems. Mobile energy storage and unmanned aerial vehicles have high economy and flexibility, so they can provide various services including power support and temporary information transmission when disasters occur and disable the whole system. To address the unavailability of the communication system and improve the collaborative restoration of transmission and distribution systems, this paper proposes a multi-period distributionally robust resilience enhancement model (MPDRRM) for the transmission and distribution coordinated system, and a large quantity of mobile energy storage and unmanned aerial vehicles are rented before natural disasters and dispatched to support critical loads and maintain power balance during restoration. The MPDRRM is divided into three kinds of sub-problems: i) a communication system sub-problem, ii) a transmission system sub-problem, iii) several distribution system sub-problems, and solved by a modified three-level analytical target cascading algorithm. Case studies demonstrate the benefits of mobile energy storage and unmanned aerial vehicles in improving load restoration and increasing the resilience of a TDCS against natural disasters. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The possibilities and promises of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for smart agriculture, 5G cellular integration, package delivery, and persistent surveillance are but a few of the active drivers for advancing UAV technology and systems. The UAVs' dependence on battery power represents a key limitation for practical deployment. As every remote pilot understands, even a modest research payload can limit a UAV's endurance to under 20 min. When horizontal maneuverability is not required, a power tether from the ground can provide near infinite flight time. Commercial tethers exist but can be prohibitively expensive or underpowered for research payloads. This paper describes the detailed design, construction, and operation of a relatively inexpensive open-source alternative. The designed and prototyped tether system delivers 1 kW of power at the tether base which, on an efficient UAV, corresponds to a payload of approximately 4.75 kg. We discuss the tradeoffs, design choices, best practices, and customization options, and provide empirical data for characterizing the power-payload relationship. The power and payload are scalable thanks to the modular design and the tools presented in this paper. The very low cost compared to commercial heavy-lift tether systems and the open-source design enable reproducibility and widespread use for supporting research, development, and emerging services/applications. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The production of the Korla fragrant pear is significant, but the optimal harvesting time is short; therefore, the reasonable use of mechanical arms for harvesting is conducive to promoting the sustainable development of the fragrant pear industry. The efficiency of a robot arm when picking fragrant pears is not only determined by the successful extraction of fragrant pears in a complex environment, but the picking sequence of fragrant pears also directly affects the efficiency of the robot arm. In order to simulate an orchard-picking scenario, this paper built three fragrant pear tree models indoors. The number of fragrant pears on the fragrant pear trees was 5, 10, and 20. Three sets of experiments were designed for comparison with real-world conditions. The main steps were as follows: calibrate the three-dimensional coordinates of each fragrant pear on the fragrant pear trees; determine the end position of the robotic arm at each picking point; find the inverse solution for each group; transform the solutions into matrix form using the rated power of each joint as the weight, and identify the minimum value, which is the angle of each joint in the robotic arm when picking the fragrant pear; use the intelligent socket to find the average energy consumption and average time consumed for picking each group of fragrant pears; and determine the loss ratio of the robotic arm based on the amount of rotation in each joint during picking. The experimental results show that the multiple weighting method reduced the energy consumption by 10.627%, 16.072%, and 24.417%, and the time consumption by 11.988%, 14.428%, and 22.561%, respectively, relative to the hybrid ant colony–particle swarm optimization algorithm, which proves the rationality of the fragrant pear picking order delineated using the multiple weighting method. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly important role in assisting fast-response post-disaster rescue due to their fast deployment, flexible mobility, and low cost. However, UAVs face the challenges of limited battery capacity and computing resources, which could shorten the expected flight endurance of UAVs and increase the rescue response delay during performing mission-critical tasks. To address these challenges, we first present a three-layer post-disaster rescue computing architecture by leveraging the aerial-terrestrial edge capabilities of mobile edge computing (MEC) and vehicle fog computing (VFC), which consists of a vehicle fog layer, a UAV client layer, and a UAV edge layer. Moreover, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem (JTRAOP) with the aim of maximizing the time-average system utility. Since the formulated JTRAOP is proved to be NP-hard, we propose an MEC-VFC-aided task offloading and resource allocation (MVTORA) approach, which consists of a game theoretic algorithm for task offloading decision, a convex optimization-based algorithm for MEC resource allocation, and an evolutionary computation-based hybrid algorithm for VFC resource allocation. Simulation results validate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to alternative approaches, especially under heavy system workloads. IEEE},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones have emerged as a ubiquitous and integral part of our society. They appear in great diversity in a multiplicity of applications for economic, commercial, leisure, military and academic purposes. The drone industry has seen a sharp uptake in the last decade as a model to manufacture and deliver convergence, offering synergy by incorporating multiple technologies. It is due to technological trends and rapid advancements in control, miniaturization, and computerization, which culminate in secure, lightweight, robust, more-accessible and cost-efficient UAVs. UAVs support implicit particularities including access to disaster-stricken zones, swift mobility, airborne missions and payload features. Despite these appealing benefits, UAVs face limitations in operability due to several critical concerns in terms of flight autonomy, path planning, battery endurance, flight time and limited payload carrying capability, as intuitively it is not recommended to load heavy objects such as batteries. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to provide insights into the potentials of UAVs, as well as their characteristics and functionality issues. This study provides a comprehensive review of UAVs, types, swarms, classifications, charging methods and regulations. Moreover, application scenarios, potential challenges and security issues are also examined. Finally, future research directions are identified to further hone the research work. We believe these insights will serve as guidelines and motivations for relevant researchers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Given the significant impact of the UN 2015 agenda on sustainable development, the search for eco-friendly and efficient energy solutions has intensified. The renewable based hybrid systems have emerged as feasible solution in this context. This paper explores the potential of utilizing a hybrid energy system (HES) from a distinctive perspective — addressing the challenges of load shedding at the distribution level. The HES configuration in this investigation includes photovoltaic (PV) array, wind turbines (WT), battery storage unit (BSU) and diesel generator system. The research involves simulations, optimization, and sensitivity analysis for a residential community in the southwestern part of Pakistan, which frequently experiences load shedding. Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) is applied to simultaneously minimize the levelized electricity cost (LEC), payback period (PBP), and loss of power supply probability (LPSP). Simulations compare different HES configurations based on the estimation of local renewable energy potential and the load shedding schedule of the utility company. The optimal solution, with NPV =110, NWT =2, and NBSU =16, was selected, resulting in a minimum LEC of 6.64 cents/kWh and a PBP of 7.4 years. These results are validated using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The performance of HES is benchmarked against conventional solutions, such as standalone diesel generators, battery-based uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and combinations of generators and UPS. The findings demonstrate the significant superiority of HES over conventional solutions in terms of reduced LEC, shorter PBP and reduced carbon emissions. Finally, the sensitivity analysis examines the impact of varying component prices, feed-in tariff rates, meteorological conditions, and load demand variations on the LEC and PBP of the HES.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The terrestrial wireless network deployment challenges and the high associated costs encourage the exploration of aerial base stations (ABSs). An ABS carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be dispatched at a relatively low cost to provide coverage on demand, such as in emergency situations and during temporary hot-spot events. While relatively inexpensive, battery-powered UAVs have a limited flight time and can only provide temporary service in practice. This article, therefore, considers and monitors the available energy of UAVs as a constraint for the proposed communication architecture consisting of dynamically dispatched ABSs that are managed by a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) performing network optimization. We consider a fleet of UAVs for providing secure wireless service to sparsely distributed users in urban areas and propose an efficient coverage strategy to satisfy the users' data rate demands while meeting their secrecy rate requirements. Because of the complexity, dynamics, and distributed nature of the problem, we employ multiple ABSs as the agents and design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to optimize their positions in the ABS network with time-constrained nodes. Numerical results illustrate how the DDPG-empowered HAPS is able to coordinate and leverage the ABSs fleet for wide-spread secure coverage and adjust the network deployment topology when nodes become unavailable. While the DDPG has a higher training complexity, it provides better performance over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of the number of securely served users. We discuss the practical implications of the training process and identify opportunities for research and development. © 2014 IEEE.},

We propose a definition of musical spaces as Hilbert spaces and musical paths between parameters as elements of bigroupoids, generalizing existing conceptions of musical spaces. The use of Hilbert spaces allows us to build up quantum representations of musical states, inheriting quantum computing resources, already used for robotic swarms. We present the theoretical framework and then some case studies as toy examples.

A total of four (4) spectral vegetation indices, viz, the Greenness Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Red-Edge Index (NDRE), and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), were generated to characterize crop types and water content in this study. Crop water content data, in the form of the relative water content (RWC), were measured in the field for each type of crop. Crop water content was modelled based on the empirical relationships between spectral indices and field-measured RWC. The linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between the GNDVI and the water content of sweet potato, maize, sugar beans, and Florida broadleaf mustard, with r2 values of 0.948, 0.995, 0.978, and 0.953, respectively. The NDVI revealed a strong association with the water content of Solanum retroflexum, pepper, and cabbage, with r2 values of 0.949, 0.956, and 0.995, respectively. The NDRE, on the other hand, revealed a strong relationship with water content in peas and green beans, with r2 values of 0.961 and 0.974, respectively. The crop water content patterns simulation revealed that Solanum retroflexum, sweet potato, maize, sugar beans, and Florida broadleaf mustard reached their respective wilting points on day four after irrigation, implying that irrigation of these crops should be scheduled after every four (4) days. Peas, green beans, pepper, and cabbage reached their respective wilting points on day five after irrigation, implying that irrigation of these crops should be scheduled after every five days. The results of this study highlight the significance of considering crop water content derived from spectral bands of UAV imagery in scheduling irrigation for various types of crops. This study also emphasized the on-going significance of remote sensing technology in addressing agricultural issues that impede hunger alleviation and food security goals. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {High-mobility unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as dual-function aerial service platforms for the Internet of Things (IoT), providing both sensing and communication services for IoT nodes without a base station (BS), particularly in emergency situations. In this paper, a UAV-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is proposed for IoT, which simultaneously senses the status information around the IoT and sends the sensing information to both the IoT nodes and a data collection center. In order to assess the sensing performance of ISAC, the radar estimation rate is introduced as a significant metric from the perspective of information theory. Considering the mutual interference between sensing and communications, the radar estimation rate is maximized through the coordinated optimization of UAV task scheduling, transmit power allocation, and 3D flight parameters under the constraint of communication rate. The formulated non-convex mixed-integer programming problem is divided into three subproblems, including UAV task scheduling optimization, UAV sensing and communication power optimization, and UAV 3D flight parameters optimization. The optimal solutions can be achieved by proposing a three-layer iterative optimization algorithm to optimize the three subproblems iteratively. The simulation results show that the radar estimation rate can well measure the sensing performance of the ISAC, which can be effectively improved by optimizing the 3D UAV flight parameters. IEEE},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for missions involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) raises the need for reliable and accurate time synchronization in ad hoc networks. Time synchronization plays a crucial role in coordinating the actions of multiple UAVs, particularly when it comes to positioning, coordination, and data fusion. However, achieving high-precision time synchronization is challenging due to the difficult-to-estimate communication transmission delay, measurement noise, relative motion, and clock source characteristics in wireless ad hoc networks formed by UAVs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fully distributed high-precision network time synchronization algorithm that is suitable for multi-hop dynamic ad hoc networks. The proposed algorithm is based on bidirectional pseudo-range measurements, graph theory, and random matrix correlation theory. It is composed of relative clock skew estimation, logic clock skew compensation and logic clock offset compensation. The algorithm is rigorously derived, requiring no central node, and it is capable of obtaining relative clock skew even when nodes broadcast clock information asynchronously. In addition, the proposed algorithm enables real-time elimination of transmission delays and has noise-resistant capabilities. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, demonstrating that the time synchronization accuracy in UAV ad hoc networks can reach the sub-nanosecond level. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {To achieve sustainable environmental development, numerous countries and governments have been vigorously promoting the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) through a series of policy measures and economic subsidies. With the increasing number of EVs, multiple EV charging modes are being researched to satisfy owners’ requirements. In this paper, an EV charging method considering multiple power exchange modes’ coordination is proposed for meeting owners’ requirements with cost-effectiveness. In the proposed method, the battery swapping (BS) station, building-to-vehicle (B2V) station, and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) station are considered. In G2V stations, EVs charge from the power grid. In B2V stations, distributed renewable energy generation is considered as the energy provider. This study contemplates the use of photovoltaic power systems in B2V stations for the charging of EVs. In BS stations, the power exchange among batteries and the power grid is considered. The battery energy storage is utilized for reducing the battery degradation cost (BDC) and power cost. EVs are dispatched to the corresponding charging stations according to the electric price, BDC, and so on. In the dispatching process, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and Hungarian algorithm are applied. Several case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the power matching between EVs and charging modes is discussed. © 2023 by the authors.},

Power outages pose significant challenges to modern societies, affecting various sectors such as industries, households, and critical infrastructures.

In response to the poor positioning accuracy caused by unknown noise in the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm for multi-sensor fusion-based pose state estimation, this paper proposes a UAV attitude estimation correction method using dynamic compensation and denoising through multi-sensor fusion. Firstly, an adaptive adjustment of the iterative transformation parameters is performed using a distance parameter adjustment strategy to optimize the distribution of Sigma sampling points. Then, dynamic estimation thresholds are used for coordinated processing of system noise and observation noise. Additionally, to address uncertain disturbances in the measurement system, a correction factor is introduced to compensate for the predicted measurement covariance. By constructing a two-dimensional matrix, outlier data points from the sensor measurements are eliminated, reducing the impact of uncertain noise on the measurement system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic correction and denoising UKF algorithm, compared to the standard UKF algorithm, improves the accuracy of state estimation and exhibits good precision and robustness in UAV multi-sensor fusion-based pose state estimation tests.

Despite the potential for full autonomy, many applications still necessitate human operators for navigating complex environments and decision-making. Existing solutions often employ high-precision and simple sensors like 2-D or 3-D LiDAR, which may provide more data than necessary and contribute to increased system complexity and cost. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between full autonomy and human-controlled UAVs, this work develops a shared-autonomy framework for UAVs, leveraging lightweight, low-cost 1-D LiDAR sensors combined with mobility behaviors to obtain performance comparable to more advanced 2-D/3-D LiDAR sensors while minimizing energy, computation overhead, and weight. Our framework includes a novel state machine method that exploits the UAV mobility to compensate for the limitations of 1-D LiDAR sensors, ensuring safety and obstacle avoidance through a physics-based algorithm that transitions between teleoperation and autonomous mode as needed based on environmental conditions and safety-critical issues. Experimental validations on real UAVs demonstrates the effectiveness of this shared autonomy scheme in complex environments, and the system is further generalized to larger UAVs and prototyped with a custom sensor configuration and onboard obstacle avoidance.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Everything is getting smarter nowadays, from mobiles to lifestyle, then why cannot be smart delivery services? Increased travel demand in urban areas is one of the salient factors of congestion on the existing network. With this tremendous rate of increase, existing infrastructure is not competent to meet the rising demand, nor is it sustainable point to build multiple roads at every place and ongoing routes. It is not feasible every time to increase resources which in turn will lead to more delays and congestion. So, there is an utmost need to explore the emerging autonomous technologies that can minimize the process of human-to-human interaction and ensure reliable, fastest, and efficient delivery of transport packages, food items, or other postal delivery services. It’s time to integrate small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into intelligent transportation systems that will empower efficient and smart delivery of services. Consider a case of food delivery process which is being transformed digitally by the use of smartphones and tracking apps. Nevertheless, the digital ordering of food via apps has made the process easier and relaxing but it has failed to mitigate congestion problem in urban cities. Now, there is a need to move one more step higher by making transportation services smart, reliable, and congestion free. The solution to this smart transportation services lies in the employment of Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs). The former vehicle system (i.e. AGV) applies to generic term that signifies autonomous cars or autonomous robots with varying sizes and weights traveling specific distances that the parcel needs to be delivered to, whereas the latter vehicle system (i.e. AAV) represents drones or unmanned vehicles that are being utilized to transport packages, providing healthcare services, postal and food delivery services, as well as other utility services in the case of emergency situations. Drones and robots are the futuristic and emerging technologies that are defying the need of orthodox delivery systems. These automated vehicles enhance capacity of traditional fleets and are equipped with sensors and simulators that perform specific tasks in an efficient manner. Nowadays, they are in high demand by corporates, food business partners, and various organizations. Usage of drones and robots also proved efficient during COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, such that it minimized human-to-human interactions and eventually mitigated the risk of infections; it also increased capacity enhancement of delivery services when everything was out of order during pandemic. In addition to this, these automated vehicles delivered medical supply and goods even in highly congested areas. The development of this study is the outcome of serious need for service innovation. As explained here, each autonomous technology has been applied in various services ranging from food delivery to medical goods. The main idea is that these autonomous technologies have the potential to minimize congestion and traffic by efficiently and reliably utilizing delivery journeys off the road network. That’s why robotics and automation have become a vast research area in the era of technology. In this chapter, three types of delivery systems are discussed and analyzed using the robot and drone technologies. The system includes AGV systems, AAV systems, and hybrid system that utilizes both robots and drones. AGV includes usage of a fleet of robots that run on pedestrians and sideways without interfering with ongoing road traffic network. AAV consists of fleet of drones operating and delivering food parcels at higher speeds. The third system is the hybrid system which is an amalgamation of ground vehicle system and aerial vehicle systems. In this system, robots are utilized for pick-up services in highly congested areas where drone landing is not feasible, and then package is placed in the drone, which is ready to be delivered from pick-up location to destination. A deep analysis of integration of autonomous and emerging technologies in the context of delivery systems is conducted by taking a place named Connaught Place (CP) into consideration. As it is a highly congested place, it will produce good simulation results when parameters and coordinates are taken during peak hours. The aim of this study is multifold: (a) research into robots and drone delivery systems. It includes scheduling algorithms to calculate average waiting time during short intervals of time. To maintain uniformity, suppose it is calculated at an interval of 10 seconds and average turnaround response time is estimated for drones, robots, and hybrid systems; (b) proposed models of three delivery systems with regard to live coordinates recorded during peak hours at CP in Delhi; (c) analyzing the performance of three systems in context of scheduling, time intervals, and waiting times by using appropriate scheduling strategies; and (d) the chapter ends with conclusion and future scope followed by references. In this chapter, it is discussed that all three proposed systems carry single parcel or order at a time but as a future scope, it can be stated that drones carry multiple parcels at a time to minimize customer waiting time and increases optimization. It would also require safety analysis for such situations. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Rajendra Kumar, Vishal Jain, Leong Wai Yie and Sunantha Teyarachakul; individual chapters, the contributors.},

This paper presents a joint location technology of TDOA/FDOA based on particle swarm optimization algorithm to achieve high-precision positioning of the target. The linearly decreasing inertia weight and natural selection mechanism are combined with this new method, which will effectively avoid positioning results falling into local optimal values, increase population diversity and improve the quality of the solution. This method can approximate the global optimal solution without initial target position estimation. In order to be applied to practical engineering applications, the WGS-84 geodetic coordinate system will be introduced to describe the earth model. From the simulation results, the proposed method has higher locating accuracy compared to standard particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the end of this paper, the GDOP positioning accuracy of the target reconnaissance area is analyzed by using different UAV formation layout, which provides some reference value for practical engineering application. © 2023, Beijing HIWING Sci. and Tech.

	abstract = {To achieve sustainable development goals, it is crucial to ensure the best practices through the whole mining cycle of critical raw materials (CRM) used in high-Tech, low-carbon goods (batteries, wind turbines, electronics). This is the aim of the SECURE AND SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS FOR EU INDUSTRY (S34I) Horizon Europe (HE) project that began on January 1st, 2023. S34I is investigating new data-driven methods to analyze Earth Observation (EO) data, supporting systematic mineral exploration (and other) activities to increase European autonomy regarding CRM resources. The S34I project is based on satellite data, airborne, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), ground-based conventional in-situ techniques/methods, and fieldwork. This study presents the first preliminary results based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data using classical image processing techniques (RGB combinations, band ratio, Principal Component Analysis PCA, and unsupervised classification) for mineral exploration in Spain, either: (i) on land (Aramo area), to gain knowledge on cobalt (Co) deposits (and associate CRMs) by hydrothermal alteration mapping; and (ii) offshore/shallow waters (Ria de Vigo area), to update the knowledge on coastal metallic placers including CRMs such as Ti, Sn, Li, rare earth elements (REEs) and Au. Among the techniques, PCA proved most effective, followed by band ratios, and selfproposed algorithms for detecting placer minerals showed promise, warranting further investigation. In the future, S34I will exploit Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCM) and other EU hyperspectral satellite sensors such as PRISMA and EnMAP. Different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques will, in the future, promote advances and innovative methods that mining stakeholders can use to address the challenges faced in different phases of the mining life-cycle. © 2023 SPIE.

Disaster management after the immediate onset of such sudden occurrences intimates readiness in technology, availability, accessibility, perception, training, evaluation, and deploy ability.

	abstract = {The current Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system based on vehicle sensors has a field of view blind spot, greatly limiting its function. This paper proposes an optimization strategy for commercial vehicle AEB system based on unsafe control behavior to improve the safety and reliability of the AEB system. Firstly, the communication delay law of vehicle-to-vehicle communication under different working conditions is obtained through real vehicle tests. The delay is then used to compensate and correct parameters such as speed, displacement, and coordinates of the environmental vehicle, in order to account for the impact of communication delay on system decision-making. Next, an AEB strategy for commercial vehicles at the intersection section is formulated. When two vehicles are about to collide, the braking system of the test vehicle is controlled to automatically emergency brake with the maximum braking deceleration to avoid collision. The AEB system strategy is optimized based on the analysis of unsafe control behavior. Then, an improved Antenna historical optimum-based Beetle Antenna Search (ABAS) algorithm is proposed based on the Beetle Antenna Search (BAS) and Beetle Swarm Antenna Search (BSAS) algorithm, which improves the optimization performance of the algorithm under the known constraint space, such as vehicle motion modeling and collision avoidance. Finally, the simulation result show that our proposed method can effectively prevent the collision of two vehicles at the intersection, and has high safety and reliability. IEEE},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones are widely employed for several application areas such as surveillance, disaster management, etc. Since UAVs are limited to energy, efficient coordination between them becomes essential to optimally utilize the resources and effective communication among them and base station (BS). Therefore, clustering can be employed as an effective way of accomplishing smart communication systems among multiple UAVs. In this aspect, this paper presents a group teaching optimization algorithm with deep learning enabled smart communication system (GTOADL-SCS) technique for UAV networks. The proposed GTOADL-SCS model encompasses a two stage process namely clustering and classification. At the initial stage, the GTOADL-SCS model includes a GTOA based clustering scheme to elect cluster heads (CHs) and organize clusters. Besides, the GTOADL-SCS model develops a fitness function containing three input parameters as residual energy of UAVs, average neighoring distance, and UAV degree. For classification process, the GTOADL-SCS model applies pre-trained densely connected network (DenseNet201) feature extractor with gated recurrent unit (GRU) classifier. For ensuring the enhanced performance of the GTOADL-SCS model, a widespread simulation analysis is performed and the comparative study reported the significant outcomes over the existing approaches with maximum packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 92.60%. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

	abstract = {[Objective] Wheat, as one of the major global food crops, plays a key role in food production and food supply. Different influencing factors can lead to different types of wheat lodging, e.g., root lodging may be due to improper use of fertilizers. While stem lodging is mostly due to harsh environments, different types of wheat lodging can have different impacts on yield and quality. The aim of this study was to categorize the types of wheat lodging by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image detection and to investigate the effect of UAV flight altitude on the classification performance. [Methods] Three UAV flight altitudes (15, 45, and 91 m) were set to acquire images of wheat test fields. The main research methods contained three parts: an automatic segmentation algorithm, wheat classification model selection, and an improved classification model based on EfficientNetV2-C. In the first part, the automatic segmentation algorithm was used to segment the UAV to acquire the wheat test field at three different heights and made it into the training dataset needed for the classification model. The main steps were first to preprocess the original wheat test field images acquired by the UAV through scaling, skew correction, and other methods to save computation time and improve segmentation accuracy. Subsequently, the pre-processed image information was analyzed, and the green part of the image was extracted using the super green algorithm, which was binarized and combined with the edge contour extraction algorithm to remove the redundant part of the image to extract the region of interest, so that the image was segmented for the first time. Finally, the idea of accumulating pixels to find sudden value added was used to find the segmentation coordinates of two different sizes of wheat test field in the image, and the region of interest of the wheat test field was segmented into a long rectangle and a short rectangle test field twice, so as to obtain the structural parameters of different sizes of wheat test field and then to generate the dataset of different heights. In the second part, four machine learning classification models of support vector machine (SVM), K nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and naive bayes (NB), and two deep learning classification models (ResNet101 and EfficientNetV2) were selected. Under the unimproved condition, six classification models were utilized to classify the images collected from three UAVs at different flight altitudes, respectively, and the optimal classification model was selected for improvement. In the third part, an improved model, EfficientNetV2-C, with EfficientNetV2 as the base model, was proposed to classify and recognized the lodging type of wheat in test field images. The main improvement points were attention mechanism improvement and loss function improvement. The attention mechanism was to replace the original model squeeze and excitation (SE) with coordinate attention (CA), which was able to embed the position information into the channel attention, aggregate the features along the width and height directions, respectively, during feature extraction, and capture the long-distance correlation in the width direction while retaining the long-distance correlation in the length direction, accurate location information, enhancing the feature extraction capability of the network in space. The loss function was replaced by class-balanced focal loss (CB-Focal Loss), which could assign different loss weights according to the number of valid samples in each class when targeting unbalanced datasets, effectively solving the impact of data imbalance on the classification accuracy of the model. [Results and Discussions] Four machine learning classification results: SVM average classification accuracy was 81.95%, DT average classification accuracy was 79.56%, KNN average classification accuracy was 59.32%, and NB average classification accuracy was 59.48%. The average classification accuracy of the two deep learning models, ResNet101 and EfficientNetV2, was 78.04%, and the average classification accuracy of ResNet101 was 81.61%. Comparing the above six classification models, the EfficientNetV2 classification model performed optimally at all heights. And the improved EfficientNetV2-C had an average accuracy of 90.59%, which was 8.98% higher compared to the average accuracy of EfficientNetV2. The SVM classification accuracies of UAVs at three flight altitudes of 15, 45, and 91 m were 81.33%, 83.57%, and 81.00%, respectively, in which the accuracy was the highest when the altitude was 45 m, and the classification results of the SVM model values were similar to each other, which indicated that the imbalance of the input data categories would not affect the model's classification effect, and the SVM classification model was able to solve the problem of high dimensionality of the data efficiently and had a good performance for small and medium-sized data sets. The SVM classification model could effectively solve the problem of the high dimensionality of data and had a better classification effect on small and medium-sized datasets. For the deep learning classification model, however, as the flight altitude increases from 15 to 91 m, the classification performance of the deep learning model decreased due to the loss of image feature information. Among them, the classification accuracy of ResNet101 decreased from 81.57% to 78.04%, the classification accuracy of EfficientNetV2 decreased from 84.40% to 81.61%, and the classification accuracy of EfficientNetV2-C decreased from 97.65% to 90.59%. The classification accuracy of EfficientNetV2-C at each of the three altitudes. The difference between the values of precision, recall, and F1-Score results of classification was small, which indicated that the improved model in this study could effectively solve the problems of unbalanced model classification results and poor classification effect caused by data imbalance. [Conclusions] The improved EfficientNetV2-C achieved high accuracy in wheat lodging type detection, which provides a new solution for wheat lodging early warning and crop management and is of great significance for improving wheat production efficiency and sustainable agricultural development. copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) can flexibly travel through narrow space for complex workspace tasks. However, it is challenging to design the trajectory tracking algorithm for CDCRs due to their nonlinear dynamic behaviors and cable hysteresis characteristics. In this contribution, a model predictive control (MPC) tracking algorithm based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is designed for CDCRs to realize effective trajectory tracking under constraints. In order to make kinematic analysis of a CDCR, the forward and inverse mapping among actuation space, joint space and work space is analyzed by using the piecewise constant curvature method and the homogeneous coordinate transformation. To improve the performance of conventional MPC for complex tracking tasks, QPSO is adopted in the rolling optimization of MPC for its global optimization performance, robustness and fast convergence. Both simulation and operational experiment results demonstrate that the designed QPSO-MPC presents high control stability and trajectory tracking precision. Compared with MPC and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based MPC, the tracking error of QPSO-MPC is reduced by at least 43 and 24%, respectively. Copyright © 2022 Chen, Qin and Li.},

	abstract = {Compared with machine tools, five degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) hybrid robots have been widely concerned in the manufacturing of large complex surface parts due to their characteristics of high flexibility and large workspace. It is of great significance to schedule the time-optimal feedrate that satisfies the high-order constraints (e.g., jerk or jounce) in the toolpath and joint systems to achieve the high-precision and high-efficiency machining of the robot. To overcome the complexity of five-axis feedrate scheduling and improve the optimality of machining time, this paper proposes a jerk-limited heuristic feedrate scheduling (HFS) method with near-optimal time. Firstly, the analytical equations between all constraints and the parametric feedrate are derived, and the mathematical model for control points optimization of the parametric feedrate profile expressed by a B-spline curve is established. Then, combined with the global search particle swarm optimization (GSPSO) algorithm, a proposed moving window planning method optimizes a small number of control points so that the feedrate curve has enough rising space. Subsequently, to obtain the near time-optimal feedrate, the local search PSO (LSPSO) algorithm within the moving window is developed to locally adjust the non-uniformly inserted control points. Compared with the existing methods, the HFS method is beneficial to further optimize the machining time with a faster computation speed, and ensure the stability of the robot machining. Finally, simulations and experiments on the developed TriMule-800 hybrid robot verify the effectiveness of this method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {UAV cluster technology is widely used in logistics, military, agriculture, and other fields. It is an important direction for future development. Because of the characteristics of high cluster complexity, strong information interaction capabilities, and variability in application fields, the analytical evaluation of cluster systems are increasingly popular. The focus of attention. Due to the UAV cluster's multi-level and multi-element complex interaction, the abstract evaluation of the cluster system using the complex network topology is critical. But the actual task process of the cluster system is variability, emergence, and autonomy. Such as dynamic performance, it isn't easy to comprehensively analyze the entire task process only by relying on the static complex network topology, and the application parameters evaluated are relatively theoretical. With the continuous development of simulation technology, the multi-agent simulation modeling method is very suitable for simulating complex group behaviors with unknown states and emergence due to the interaction characteristics of multi-state independent agents. Applying the multi-agent simulation modeling method to the field of UAV clusters can solve the problem that the existing complex network methods are challenging to simulate the actual task process of the cluster. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of using multi-agent simulation to provide dynamic parameters. This method combines the evaluatssion and analysis method of complex network topology to evaluate the system-level network indicators of the drone cluster task process. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Digital twins can improve the level of control over physical entities and help manage complex systems by integrating a range of technologies. The autonomous agricultural machine has shown revolutionary effects on labor reduction and utilization rate in field works. Autonomous vehicles in precision agriculture have the potential to improve competitiveness compared to current crop production methods and have become a research hotspot. However, the development time and resources required in experiments have limited the research in this area. Simulation tools in unmanned farming that are required to enable more efficient, reliable, and safe autonomy are increasingly demanding. Inspired by the recent development of an open-source virtual simulation platform, this study proposed an autoware-based simulator to evaluate the performance of agricultural machine guidance based on digital twins. Oblique photogrammetry using drones is used to construct three-dimensional maps of fields at the same scale as reality. A communication format suitable for agricultural machines was developed for data input and output, along with an inter-node communication methodology. The conversion, publishing, and maintenance of multiple coordinate systems were completed based on ROS (Robot Operating System). Coverage path planning was performed using hybrid curves based on Bézier curves, and it was tested in both a simulation environment and actual fields with the aid of Pure Pursuit algorithms and PID controllers. © 2023, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Hyperlocal delivery service is a digital platform business that receives on-demand orders from customers to deliver products from a local offline shop in logistics. Deploying drones/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on the hyperlocal market is still a relatively unexplored phenomenon and that demands attention on sustainable drone delivery strategies. This paper introduces both non-flexible and flexible drone delivery strategies for the hyperlocal market. Further, drone operational complexities like deciding a precise location for landing and take-off in congested cities, limited flight endurance, incorporating docking stations in drone routes and drone safe-return strategy are investigated. This problem is formulated as the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, which minimises the drone's total distance by the optimal energy consumption to complete the scheduled services. For practical feasibility, this paper focuses on heuristic solutions that effectively solve the problem efficiently and near optimally. The approach facilitates the operations manager to decide on an appropriate drone travel capacity based on service distance and the size of on-demand customers in an urban hyper-local logistics environment. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The internal combustion engine-based transportation system is causing severe problems such as rising levels of pollution, rising petroleum prices, and the depletion of natural resources. To divide power between the engine and the battery in an effective manner, a sophisticated energy management system is required to be put into place. A power split strategy that is efficient may result in higher fuel economy and performance of Electric Vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we propose the reinforcement learning method using Deep Q learning (DQL), which is a novel Improved Swarm optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (IS-DRLA) designed for energy management control. To perform an update on the weights of the neural network, this method computes the use of a modified version of the swarm optimization technique. After that, the suggested IS-DRLA system goes through training and verification using high-precision realistic driving conditions, after which it is contrasted with the standard approach. The performance indices such as State of Charge (SOC) and fuel consumption and loss function are analyzed for the efficiency of the proposed method (IS-DRLA). According to the findings, the newly proposed IS-DRLA is capable of achieving a higher training pace with a lower overall fuel consumption than the conventional policy, and its fuel economy comes very close to matching that of the worldwide optimal. In addition to this, the adaptability of the suggested strategy is demonstrated by utilizing a different driving schedule. © 2023 Sumy State University},

	abstract = {The underwater environment is crucial for various scientific applications, including naval bases, offshore installations, and military surveillance. Precise intruder detection in such environments via underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASN) with minimal network resources is quite challenging in safeguarding the territorial marine environment. Moreover, the unavailability of GPS, poor visibility, and diverging network scenarios make it more complicated than terrestrial sensor networks. Hence, this article addresses an energy-efficient surveillance scheme using only one beacon -node for intrusion detection subject to location precision, energy restrictions, and network overhead constraints. The proposed energy-conscious surveillance scheme monitors the chosen region of interest (ROI) with a single beacon node using its Boolean perception probability to find an intruder node in its area of responsibility. Next, a low-cost centroid technique is applied to calculate the estimated location coordinates of the intruder node. Estimated intruder coordinates are further enhanced using a rapid convergent Tunicate swarm algorithm (TSO). Thorough findings from simulations reveal that the proposed technique reduces the overhead of employing numerous beacon nodes while substantially improving the intruder position accuracy compared to its contemporary schemes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm communication has drawn much attention in search and rescue (SAR) missions owing to its wide wireless coverage and increasing autonomy in navigation. In this article, we consider maximizing the downlink wireless coverage of a UAV swarm in an unknown mission area by controlling the quasistationary deployments of UAVs. Particularly, the stochastic wireless link failures caused by channel fading and noise in UAV-to-UAV communication links are considered in coverage control. Specifically, due to delay sensitivity and onboard energy limitation of UAV-enabled SAR networks, we study a distributed control strategy where swarm UAVs can address the coverage problem by exchanging only the local information. In this case, the wireless coverage problem is divided into several distributed optimization subproblems. However, due to the integer variable and nonlinear constraints, each subproblem is nonconvex and mutually coupling, which makes it difficult to solve via standard convex optimization solvers. Thus, we model the UAV swarm network as an undirected random graph and then solve the optimization subproblems by formulating a UAV swarm wireless coverage game. As per the designed utility function and potential function of the formulated game, existence of the pure Nash equilibrium is discussed and a distributed algorithm is developed to achieve the best Nash equilibrium. We analyze the convergence property and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, we analyze effects of the initial learning rate and step size on algorithm performance from both theoretical and simulation results. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the coverage by around 58% when compared with initial performance. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Soft materials are attractive to engineers due to their low density, ability to sustain large deformations and customization of properties. These custom properties are realized by tailoring the microstructural architecture and optimizing the constituent materials. However, achieving complex behavior at the macroscale is difficult through conventional engineering top-down approaches. Instead, we draw inspiration from a more biological bottom-up approach based on the concept of emergence. Slime molds and fungi are fascinating models for emergence; formed by aggregation of almost identical cells, their internal networks optimize transport better than engineers, solve mazes, detect masses at a distance, or memorize periodic events. We establish here a theoretical and computational framework to explain, quantify and reproduce how this feedback between macroscopic features and local tuning of mechanical properties determines an emergent coordinated response of the network morphology. These networks have the ability to grow, survive, or die in the presence of different concentrations of nutrients and to redistribute them, thus optimizing their proliferation. We propose a phase-field scalar variable to represent the network matrix evolution and a diffusive-advective process for nutrient distribution. This framework enables high-fidelity simulations of slime molds in three-dimensional space, which are challenging due to the coupled physics involved, high-order partial differential equations, and the existence of a highly complex evolving geometry. The emergent properties of these organisms are similar in nature to tissues with transport networks, and we can exploit them to design self-healing materials, fungal sustainable building elements, or even coordinate drone swarms.

We use stigmergy-based digital pheromone maps along with distance-based local connectivity information to autonomously coordinate the UAV movements, in order to improve its map coverage efficiency while maintaining high network connectivity.  © 2023 IEEE.},

This article presents a framework of multi-UAV multitask allocation and trajectory planning with collision avoidance. The scenario of interest is one where multiple UAVs are launched in order to investigate selected targets in a massive wildfire disaster relief terrain. Initially, one UAV is launched to search wildfire locations and wildfire lines by a developed informative path planning algorithm. An informative exploratory search mechanism is developed that provides the exploration trajectories to precisely locate the wildfire positions in the wildfire environments. Afterward, with the investigated environmental information including GPS coordinates of wildfire positions and distribution as targets, UAVs are deployed to multiple target positions. In order to perform effective collision avoidance, a spatial dislocation scheme is developed by introduction of an additional dimension for UAVs at different altitudes, whereas UAVs avoid collision at the same altitude using a proposed velocity profile paradigm. Concurrent multitask allocation, trajectory planning, and collision avoidance are successfully carried out with unequal numbers of UAVs and targets. The proposed framework has been validated by simulation studies and comparative analyzes. © 1965-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), drones, is strongly increasing in various purposes in industry and in different sectors of society in general. Digital transformation is a megatrend also in aviation and it will bring significant changes to manned and unmanned aviation. Drones are already widely used e.g., in surveillance and security control tasks and in rescue and search missions. The use of UAV technology and related systems in everyday work processes and tasks will change many of the traditional operations and services. Drone based services are going towards high autonomy and drones will soon operate over the populated areas. Drones and their operating systems and energy supply systems are new assets. The safety and security implications and risks of these systems are still not well known among the drone operators and people affected by nearby flying equipment. To solve these challenges and to manage new risks several international activities are ongoing. European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has defined new risk-based categories for drone operations: open, specific, and certified. A risk assessment method SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) has been developed by EASA for the analysis and assessment of air and ground risks in specific category drone operations. The aim of our study is to create understanding of UAV related emerging risks at work sites in urban areas. In this paper we first review and discuss air and ground risks that are under consideration in SORA when applying the operational authorisation for specific category drone operations. We also look beyond the scope covered by the SORA assessment and identify other indirect risks or safety implications associated with drone operations when there are people working nearby. In addition to safety risks, we also introduce potential security threats and discuss their implications in drone operations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Energy-efficient and sustainable buildings have become a specialized research theme for energy planning and the green building industry. Rapidly increased energy consumption in the residential area has attracted researchers' attention to minimize energy consumption without affecting occupant comfort. Accordingly, an effective energy management system is required for energy-efficient buildings to utilize energy resources efficiently and maintain desired comfort. In this paper, data-driven based optimization models are compared to maximize the comfort index and minimize energy consumption simultaneously. Heating-cooling systems are used to maintain indoor thermal comfort, which consumes energy according to the environmental temperature and indoor temperature difference. Therefore, the environmental temperature parameter is optimized using optimization techniques Genetic Algorithm (GA), Bat, Neural Network Algorithm (NNA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). The main objective of the optimization is to reduce the gap/error between the temperature specified by the user and the environmental temperature. Afterward, the discrepancy between optimized temperature and actual temperature is fed to the designed ML (Machine Learning) based controller. The controller's output is further provided to coordinator agents, which give the power to the actuators accordingly. The linearity of the proposed model improves the performance of the ML algorithm. The obtained dataset from fuzzy temperature controller has been used to design an ML controller. The experimental results show that the designed system significantly improves energy efficiency and occupant comfort for energy-efficient buildings. The BAT model has shown effectiveness in achieving a high comfort index with minimum power consumption compared to other considered models. © 2023 IETE.},

Incorporation of rescue and first aid drone-based systems in Emergency Medical Services has been proposed. The objectives being improving response time of Emergency Medical Services, assessing the victim’s health, assisting in administration of first aid, real time live feed of victim’s vitals to the responders and mainly to outline how sustainability in healthcare can be achieved through adaptation of the proposed system. The key features of the first aid drone-based system include: a compact, architecture, aerodynamically optimized architecture and high strength to weight ratio. Solid Works has been used for modelling and simulation of the proposed system. Results showed that the maximum stress (295MPa) experienced in the link is less than the yield strength of carbon fiber (1000MPa), therefore, the design is safe. Findings also showed that, the proposed system can help to further bridge the gap between technology and healthcare, hence making the current healthcare system more relevant in future. Recommendations have been made on improving the software design of the system. Further studies on the design of quadcopters with high range, payload, endurance and speed has been proposed.

	abstract = {Due to advanced sensor technology, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are producing a huge amount of data allowing advancement in all different kinds of earth observation applications. Thanks to this source of information, and driven by climate change concerns, renewable energy assessment became an increasing necessity among researchers and companies. Solar power, going from household rooftops to utility-scale farms, is reshaping the energy markets around the globe. However, the automatic identification of photovoltaic (PV) panels and solar farms’ status is still an open question that, if answered properly, will help gauge solar power development and fulfill energy demands. Recently deep learning (DL) methods proved to be suitable to deal with remotely sensed data, hence allowing many opportunities to push further research regarding solar energy assessment. The coordination between the availability of remotely sensed data and the computer vision capabilities of deep learning has enabled researchers to provide possible solutions to the global mapping of solar farms and residential photovoltaic panels. However, the scores obtained by previous studies are questionable when it comes to dealing with the scarcity of photovoltaic systems. In this paper, we closely highlight and investigate the potential of remote sensing-driven DL approaches to cope with solar energy assessment. Given that many works have been recently released addressing such a challenge, reviewing and discussing them, it is highly motivated to keep its sustainable progress in future contributions. Then, we present a quick study highlighting how semantic segmentation models can be biased and yield significantly higher scores when inference is not sufficient. We provide a simulation of a leading semantic segmentation architecture U-Net and achieve performance scores as high as 99.78%. Nevertheless, further improvements should be made to increase the model’s capability to achieve real photovoltaic units. © 2023 Lviv Polytechnic National University.},

The optimization results based on classical test functions showed that compared with particle swarm optimization algorithm, original bat algorithm and other improved bat algorithms, IBA -FCS algorithm had better optimization performance. Aiming at the track planning problem of agricultural UAV, combined with the three-dimensional terrain data of mountain orchard flight environment, the safety track planning model of agricultural UAV was constructed, and the flight cost function with multi-factor constraints was designed; at the same time, the solution space of the track planning model was transformed from Cartesian coordinate system to cylindrical coordinate system to further improve the optimization efficiency of IBA - FCS algorithm, so as to obtain a better track planning scheme. Simulation results showed that in multiple missions with different numbers of obstacles, the fitness of IBA - FCS algorithm was 20.335 5% lower than that of original BA algorithm, and the fitness of IBA - FCS algorithm based on cylindrical coordinate space was 4. 612 7% lower than that of IBA - FCS algorithm based on Cartesian coordinate space.

Considering the scenario that a survey UAV performs tasks using the emergency communication network, in order to extend the overall endurance of the emergency communication network, in this paper, the energy efficiency of the system is maximize by jointly optimizing the relay selection and flight trajectory of the UAV. In addition, the available communication energy of the relay UAVs as well as the maximum flight speed and real-time communication quality of the survey UAV are also considered in the optimization. The resultant Nondeterministic Polynomial hard (NP-hard) optimization problem is approximately solved using an alternate algorithm, which consists of successive convex approximation and tabu search algorithm. The alternate algorithm splits the original problem into two subproblems and solves them alternately to obtain the approximate optimal solution of the optimization problem.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) regarded as flying base stations and wireless localization anchors are suitable to provide both services. One critical challenge is to guarantee the performances of both communication and localization relying on limited radio resources. In this paper, we target at orchestrating the resource provisioning for UAV-assisted communication and localization networks via flexible power control and bandwidth allocation. To this end, we establish an integrated communication-localization resource allocation problem to maximize the communication capacity and localization accuracy, subjecting to the limited power and bandwidth constraints. To solve this mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, we propose a joint power control and bandwidth allocation algorithm integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and greedy algorithm to optimize transmit power and bandwidth, respectively.

As there are raising concerns in assessing community information for charity purposes, safety coordination, and crime prevention, especially during emergencies; integrating demographic data with spatial information is becoming significantly important. This paper aims to establish an accessible and visible digital platform of demographic information for respective sectors, namely, the KRT, Qariah group, NGOs, and representatives of CSR projects. The objective is to digitize interactive demographic record management and mapping through GIS-based technology. This study adopts a Geographical Information System (GIS) to digitize information using web GIS integrating with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology for data acquisition in the community sampling areas; Puncak Iskandar. The proposed system which leverages the power of spatial analysis and visualization, utilizes GIS technology to store, analyse, and visualize demographic records in a geographical context. It incorporates various demographic data sources, such as census data, health records, and administrative data in managing more efficient and effective data with lower cost, energy, time, and resources. Furthermore, the GIS-based system enables the identification of spatial disparities, inequalities, and interventions in demographic characteristics. Therefore, the integration of this system into community demographic management has provided a powerful platform for accessing and coordinating population dynamics, problem-solving, and sustainable development. The implementation in Puncak Iskandar enhances the accessibility, and visualization of demographic data, enabling policy-makers, researchers, and planners to make informed decisions based on a geographical perspective. The findings demonstrate the reliability of GIS-based demographic record management in a community living towards supporting evidence-based planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation for a wide range of applications, including urban planning, public health, and social services towards a sustainable future. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

	abstract = {UAV-enabled data collection is considered a promising paradigm of emergency data transmission for IoT applications when the communication infrastructure is damaged. UAV scheduling for data collection as critical technology has attracted widespread attention. Most studies default to the absolute reliability of UAVs for data collection, yet it is inevitable for UAVs to fail in flight. It is unacceptable if some critical data is lost due to UAV faults. Therefore, we research fault-tolerant scheduling for data collection enabled by heterogeneous UAVs. Firstly, a three-layer data collection motivation scenario is proposed, where the fault tolerance issue is involved for the first time. Then, we propose a utility-based fault tolerance model-UBFT to balance the reliability and efficiency of data collection. The UAV fault-tolerant scheduling is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem to concurrently optimize the data throughput and load balancing of data collection. Combining the characteristics of optimization objectives, an alternating coordinate optimization method-ACTOR is presented to solve this problem efficiently. Numerous simulation experiments and real-machine experiments demonstrate that ACTOR-UBFT achieves excellent performance in fault tolerance, data throughput, adaptation, algorithm complexity, etc. IEEE},

	abstract = {More than 30,000 different species of orthoptera insects, most of which are found in the tropics and subtropics, are known to exist in the world's fauna. The most extensive among the orthopteroids is the order Orthoptera, which includes more than 20,000 species of insects. Most are herbivores, while others are predators or have a mixed diet. Large size, jumping abilities, and open lifestyle make orthopteran characters accessible to many landscapes. Orthopterans play a significant role in the movement of the energy flow as an important link in biocenosis, connecting secondary consumers with producers. Many species of Orthopterans, especially grasshoppers, are dangerous pests of agriculture. Harm is especially noticeable from those locust species, which could make swarms. The research was carried out in various agro and natural landscapes to determine the species composition of orthopteran insects in the Kashkadarya region. A total of 1274 samples were collected from 11 coordinates in 10 different landscapes during the scientific trips. They comprised 657 females (51.4%), 403 males (31.6%), and 214 nymphs (16.7%). The distribution of 70 species belonging to 50 genera and 7 families of orthopteran insects is discussed in this research. Samples were taken from 6 coordinates in 6 types (cucurbits, orchards, alfalfa, mulberry, vineyards, and mung bean fields) of agro-landscapes and 6 coordinates in 4 natural (plains of the Karshi desert, hills, mountains, and saxaul forests) landscapes. The highest species diversity has been found in orchards, where 129 samples of 20 orthopteran species have been collected in the Guzar district of the Kashkadarya region. The Karshi desert was identified as the landscape with the lowest number of species, with 41 samples of 9 species collected. The average density of insects in the desert was 0.4 per square meter. Two species were found in all 12 coordinates of 10 different landscapes, and 11 were found only once in one coordinate. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Drones are used in several purposes including examining areas, mapping surroundings and rescue mission operations. During these tasks, they could encounter compound surroundings having multiple obstacles, acute edges and deadlocks. The purpose of this paper is to propose an obstacle dodging technique required to move the drones autonomously and generate the obstacle's map of an unknown place dynamically. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, an obstacle dodging technique is essentially required to move autonomously. The automaton of drones requires complicated vision sensors and a high computing force. During this research, a methodology that uses two basic ultrasonic-oriented proximity sensors placed at the center of the drone and applies neural control using synaptic plasticity for dynamic obstacle avoidance is proposed. The two-neuron intermittent system has been established by neural control. The synaptic plasticity is used to find turning angles from different viewpoints with immediate remembrance, so it helps in decision-making for a drone. Hence, the automaton will be able to travel around and modify its angle of turning for escaping objects during the route in unknown surroundings with narrow junctions and dead ends. Furthermore, wherever an obstacle is detected during the route, the coordinate information is communicated using RESTful Web service to an android app and an obstacle map is generated according to the information sent by the drone. In this research, the drone is successfully designed and automated and an obstacle map using the V-REP simulation environment is generated. Findings: Simulation results show that the drone effectively moves and turns around the obstacles and the experiment of using web services with the drone is also successful in generating the obstacle's map dynamically. Originality/value: The obstacle map generated by autonomous drone is useful in many applications such as examining fields, mapping surroundings and rescue mission operations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It gains efficiency in repetitive task execution, such as disaster monitoring or atmospheric observation. To do this, the important task is to design a path-following algorithm. This work considers a cooperative guidance algorithm in straight-line form for the path-following formation of multiple fixed-wing UAVs under communication delays. Our developed algorithm has two main parts: path-following algorithm (called lateral guidance) and formation guidance algorithm (called longitudinal guidance). Based on a vector field approach, the former is in charge of imposing the lateral distance between the UAV and its desired path to converge in the presence of wind disturbance. The latter guarantees that multiple fixed-wing UAVs achieve a predefined formation shape under communication delay. Furthermore, an upper bound of delay that depends on the communication graph and a parameter of the formation controller is also given. In the last, a robust platform of UAV swarm benchmarks and hardware-in-the-loop tests are given to verify the feasibility and benefits of our proposed approach.  © 2023 IEEE.},

In this article, we propose a UAV search and localization strategy, which can search and locate unknown number of victims. The proposed strategy uses the UAV as a mobile anchor to measure time of arrival (TOA) and can effectively mitigate localization errors caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Generally speaking, the strategy is divided into two parts: 1) trajectory planning and 2) localization. By selecting waypoints and planning a suitable search trajectory, UAV can obtain all the measurement information in deployment area and ensure that each target has at least three anchors for localization even in the NLOS propagation environment. In the localization stage, a new estimator is proposed based on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), which estimates average NLOS bias together with the coordinates of target and can be well solved by the particle swarm algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms for mitigating NLOS error compared with other methods, and can effectively ensure high localization accuracy in the NLOS propagation environment.  © 2014 IEEE.},

There are currently just a few approaches for detecting aberrant behaviour in aggregated financial risk, and most only work after the economic risk has already been inappropriately aggregated. As a result, we provide a multi-scale convolutional neural network-based model for clustering financial risk anomaly detection (MCNN). First, we use MCNN to train a model for counting economic risks that are used to evaluate aberrant risk aggregating data. Second, we can use the test results to extract the financial risk statistics and economic risk precursor coordinate points. Then, we calculate the economic risk distribution entropy, distance, potential energy and density. To train the three elements of the development state and create the prediction model, we finally use the particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM). The results of the experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to existing algorithms, our model can efficiently realize early warning and detect abnormal behaviours of aggregated economic risks with high timeliness.

	abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) has been suggested as a potential communications alternative due to their fast implantation, which makes this resource an ideal solution to provide support in scenarios such as natural disasters or intentional attacks that may cause partial or complete disruption of telecommunications services. However, one limitation of this solution is energy autonomy, which affects mission life. With this in mind, our group has developed a new method based on reinforcement learning that aims to reduce the power consumption of UAV missions in disaster scenarios to circumvent the negative effects of wind variations, thus optimizing the timing of the aerial mesh in locations affected by the disruption of fiber-optic-based telecommunications. The method considers the K-means to stagger the position of the resource stations—from which the UAVS launched—within the topology of Stockholm, Sweden. For the UAVS’ locomotion, the Q-learning approach was used to investigate possible actions that the UAVS could take due to urban obstacles randomly distributed in the scenario and due to wind speed. The latter is related to the way the UAVS are arranged during the mission. The numerical results of the simulations have shown that the solution based on reinforcement learning was able to reduce the power consumption by 15.93% compared to the naive solution, which can lead to an increase in the life of UAV missions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the process of planting sandalwood trees on a large scale, there are problems such as low efficiency, high cost, and difficulty in the supervision of manual ranking of missing seedlings, and the necessary companion plants for each sandalwood tree and other crops interspersed between the trees, further deepening the difficulty of checking and replenishing. For these problems, a seedling deficiency detection and precise localization method in complex environment was proposed based on YOLOv4 algorithm and double regression strategy. Firstly, the YOLOv4 target detection model was used to achieve sandalwood plant detection from remote sensing images collected by UAV. Then the missing seedling localization algorithm (MSL) was constructed based on the double linear regression and extended column line fixing strategy: arbitrary sandalwood trees were selected as the benchmark, column regions were divided according to the pixel coordinates, and column lines were fitted to the sandalwood trees in each column region by using linear regression; for the omitted sandalwood trees that were not classified into columns after fitting, the attribution was judged again with the extended regression line strategy, and the column lines were optimized by linear regression again. Finally, the missing seedlings were calculated and localized according to the spacing at the time of planting. The results showed that the precision was 86.82%, the recall was 82.25%, the F1-score was 84.47%, and the running time was 8.19 s, respectively. In summary, this method combined the rapidity of DJI UAV remote sensing image acquisition system, the accuracy of YOLOv4 algorithm and double regression strategy, which can be used to achieve real-time intelligent seedling deficiency detection and accurate localization of sandalwood trees under complex growth conditions. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

However, existing research focuses mainly on the field of cooperative control of UAV clusters in single-target scenarios, without fully considering the cooperative navigation problem of UAV clusters driven by actual complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a target-driven cooperative navigation method for UAV clusters. First, a target-driven configuration change model for UAV clusters is constructed based on the iterative least squares. On this basis, a cooperative navigation node optimization strategy based on the criterion of geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is established, and an online estimation and compensation of UAV state under target-driven strategy is achieved by designing a cooperative navigation filter based on relative distance constraints and optimal spatial configuration under target-driven strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve spatial configuration transformation according to the target-driven changes of UAV clusters, and improve the overall positioning performance of UAV clusters based on the optimal spatial configuration under target-driven strategy.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Natural gas is an essential fuel in the transition towards a sustainable energy future as it is a cleaner source of fuel compared to other hydrocarbon sources. To enable natural gas delivery from the producer to consumers, natural gas is liquified to enhance transportation efficiency and reliability. This study contributes towards advancing decision support systems within the LNG supply chain to enhance sustainability and resilience. Five scenarios are investigated in terms of vessel types (Conventional, Q-Flex, Q-Max, and mixed fleet), delivery operation modes (single discharge and multi-discharge), and different bunker fuels (HFO, LNG, and dual-fuel). The Mixed Integer Programming model is used to schedule, assign and deliver a fixed number of LNG cargoes within one month considering total transportation costs and emissions. The developed model, which is implemented using the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm subjected to economic and environmental objectives within an overarching strategic aim for sustainability and resilience. The results demonstrate that using LNG as a bunker fuel supports the reduction in the total emissions within LNG transportation leading to enhancing the resilience of LNG delivery operations against growing environmental constraints. Outputs of the study indicate that the multi-discharge LNG-fuelled operation mode can achieve a cost reduction of 23.4% and a total emission reduction of 19.7% relative to a single discharge operation mode, where boil-off gas has a minor impact compared to the emissions released from fuel consumption. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the increasing prominence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) defects in recent years, high-precision inertial navigation systems (INSs) with autonomy are gradually undertaking UAV navigation tasks and are commonly fused with barometric altimeter (BA) to damp the error growth in the vertical channel without GNSS. However, anomalies or failures in barometric altitude lead to the divergence of vertical errors, while indirectly adversely affecting horizontal navigation, bringing new challenges to UAV autonomous navigation. In this article, a vertical channel-enhanced fusion method based on a high-precision rotational INS (RINS) and BA is proposed to enhance the reliability of the RINS vertical channel and correct horizontal navigation information in GNSS denial environments. On the one hand, nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) models for vertical errors are constructed based on Kalman filter (KF) fusion. And the models are identified by least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) with particle swarm optimization (PSO), referred to as NPLSSVM/KF. On the other hand, vertical errors are predicted and compensated by the trained NPLSSVM models during the BA failure, and horizontal navigation errors are also corrected. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are validated by simulation and UAV flight experiments.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A tail-sitter quadrotor is a hybrid vehicle augmenting rotary- and fixed-wing attributes. It is a simple air vehicle capable of operating in helicopter mode and seamlessly transitioning into fixed-wing mode. This multi-mode capability enhances applicability to different missions—package delivery, off-shore inspection, disaster relief, etc. However, due to the aerodynamic parameters diverging in those modes, a robust controller is needed. This chapter develops a nonlinear disturbance observer-based BSC for a tail-sitter quadrotor and the stability analysis for handling parameter variations and wind gusts. Moreover, a BSC provides decent trajectory tracking with minimal altitude shifts. UAVs are used in all sectors with a high impact on human life to save energy, time, and money for surveillance, exploration, and transportation. Rotary-wing UAVs can hover while fixed-wing UAVs don’t but have higher flight endurance—a hybrid UAV like tail-sitter quadrotor couples both advantages. Hybrid UAVs [1] can accomplish a few missions difficult for rotary-wing or fixed-wing UAVs [2]. The tail-sitter quadrotor is simple as it needs no additional actuators during the transition. Many researchers have developed small-sized tail-sitter UAVs like twin-rotor tail-sitter with elevons [3], twin helicopter rotor tail-sitters [4], quadrotor tail-sitter UAVs [5], and optimal transition strategies [6]. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {For autonomous driving vehicles, there are currently some issues, such as limited environmental awareness and locally optimal decision-making. To increase the capacity of autonomous cars’ environmental awareness, computation, decision-making, control, and execution, intelligent roads must be constructed, and vehicle–infrastructure cooperative technology must be used. The Roadside unit (RSU) deployment, a critical component of vehicle–infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving, has a direct impact on network performance, operation effects, and control accuracy. The current RSU deployment mostly uses the large-spacing and low-density concept because of the expensive installation and maintenance costs, which can accomplish the macroscopic and long-term communication functions but fall short of precision vehicle control. Given these challenges, this paper begins with the specific requirements to control intelligent vehicles in the cooperative vehicle–infrastructure environment. An RSU deployment scheme, based on the improved multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) algorithm, is proposed. This RSU deployment scheme was based on the maximum coverage with time threshold problem (MCTTP), with the goal of minimizing the number of RSUs and maximizing vehicle coverage of communication and control services. Finally, utilizing the independently created open simulation platform (OSP) simulation system, the model and algorithm’s viability and effectiveness were assessed on the Nguyen–Dupuis road network. The findings demonstrate that the suggested RSU deployment scheme can enhance network performance and control the precision of vehicle–infrastructure coordination, and can serve as a general guide for the deployment of RSUs in the same application situation. © 2023 by the authors.},

Due to their inherent low cost, ease of deployment and high mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed as FBSs can provide cost-effective, fast and reliable network access services to remote ground users. To maximize network capacity, FBSs need to coordinate and exchange information about their observations to optimize their positions, under limited energy and bandwidth resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimizing the positions of FBSs using the framework of emerging communications in multi-agent reinforcement learning (EC-MARL) and we evaluate two EC-MARL architectures, namely Multi-Agent Graph-Attention Communication and Teaming (MAGIC) and Targeted Multi-Agent Communication (TarMAC). We show that coordination between FBSs through learning a communication protocol increases the total achievable rate and coverage of ground users, compared to baselines without communication. Moreover, we consider challenging environments with a large number of FBSs and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of speed of convergence and robustness to the movement of users. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial base stations (ABSs) to provide wireless connectivity for ground users (GUs) in various emergency scenarios. However, it is a NP-hard problem with exponential complexity in M and N, in order to maximize the coverage rate of M GUs by jointly placing N ABSs with limited coverage range. The problem is further complicated when the coverage range becomes irregular due to site-specific blockages (e.g., buildings) on the air-ground channel, and/or when the GUs are moving. To address the above challenges, we study a multi-ABS movement optimization problem to maximize the average coverage rate of mobile GUs in a site-specific environment. The Spatial Deep Learning with Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (SDL-ME) algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenging problem by 1) partitioning the complicated ABS movement problem into ABS placement sub-problems each spanning finite time horizon; 2) using an encoder-decoder deep neural network (DNN) as the emulator to capture the spatial correlation of ABSs/GUs and thereby reducing the cost of interaction with the actual environment; 3) employing the emulator to speed up a quality-diversity search for the optimal placement solution; and 4) proposing a planning-exploration-serving scheme for multi-ABS movement coordination. In particular, the locations of ABSs/GUs are converted into grid pattern representations, whose dimension and associated DNN complexity are invariant with arbitrarily large M and/or N. Moreover, the virtual emulator-planning combined with the actual site-deployment effectively compensates for the prediction errors due to model approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the benchmark Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method and other two baselines in terms of average coverage rate, training time and/or sample efficiency. Moreover, with one-time training, our proposed method can be applied in scenarios where the number of ABSs/GUs dynamically changes on site and/or with different/varying GU speeds, which is thus more robust and flexible compared with conventional DRL-based methods.

This method, however, exhibits unsatisfying landing universality and low robustness in the case of bad imaging conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes the air-ground coordinated approach, using deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm for UAV autonomous landing. We utilize a pair of cameras oriented in opposite directions and mount them on the UAV and Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) separately. Images were compared and processed through the advanced target recognition algorithm to extract their relative positions. We also propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm to enable UAV maneuver on a moving UGV, which has been integrated with our Air-ground Communication Framework (ACF). The controller of the UAV will issue maneuver commands to the UAV based on the relative position acquired from the image through ACF, thus guiding the UAV to land successfully. We trained the deep reinforcement learning network and tested our approach under the Gazebo simulation environment. The test result shows an 88% of success rate and an 80% of precision for the UAV to land on the mobile UGV through the proposed approach. © 2023, Beijing HIWING Sci. and Tech. Info Inst.},

ABS's altitude is defined based on its capacity capabilities and propagation environment. The UECN cooperates with undamaged cellular infrastructure via joint coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP) with neighbouring functional terrestrial macrocell base stations (TBSs) to improve end-user signal quality.

Further, we built working prototypes that allowed our MATLAB UTM simulation to interact with ArduPilot Software-In-The-Loop simulated drones and real hardware drones that recognized targets using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Also, these prototypes demonstrated the ability to identify targets and to coordinate S&R across multiple drones.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoD), designed to coordinate the access of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is a specific application of the Internet of Things (IoT). Drones are used to control airspace and offer services such as rescue, traffic surveillance, environmental monitoring, delivery and so on. However, IoD continues to suffer from privacy and security issues. Firstly, messages are transmitted over public channels in IoD environments, which compromises data security. Further, sensitive data can also be extracted from stolen mobile devices of remote users. Moreover, drones are susceptible to physical capture and manipulation by adversaries, which are called drone capture attacks. Thus, the development of a secure and lightweight authentication scheme is essential to overcoming these security vulnerabilities, even on resource-constrained drones. In 2021, Akram et al. proposed a secure and lightweight user–drone authentication scheme for drone networks. However, we discovered that Akram et al.’s scheme is susceptible to user and drone impersonation, verification table leakage, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Furthermore, their scheme cannot provide perfect forward secrecy. To overcome the aforementioned security vulnerabilities, we propose a secure mutual authentication and key agreement scheme between user and drone pairs. The proposed scheme utilizes physical unclonable function (PUF) to give drones uniqueness and resistance against drone stolen attacks. Moreover, the proposed scheme uses a fuzzy extractor to utilize the biometrics of users as secret parameters. We analyze the security of the proposed scheme using informal security analysis, Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic, a Real-or-Random (RoR) model, and Automated Verification of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation. We also compared the security features and performance of the proposed scheme and the existing related schemes. Therefore, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is suitable for IoD environments that can provide users with secure and convenient wireless communications. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Offshore wind farms will play a vital role in the global ambition of net zero energy generation. Future offshore wind farms will be larger and further from the coast, meaning that traditional human-based operations and maintenance approaches will become infeasible due to safety, cost, and skills shortages. The use of remotely operated or autonomous robotic assistants to undertake these activities provides an attractive alternative solution. This paper presents an autonomous multirobot system which is able to transport, deploy and retrieve a wind turbine blade inspection robot using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed solution is a fully autonomous system including a robot deployment interface for deployment, a mechatronic link-hook module (LHM) for retrieval, both installed on the underside of a UAV, a mechatronic on-load attaching module installed on the robotic payload and an intelligent global mission planner. The LHM is integrated with a 2-DOF hinge that can operate either passively or actively to reduce the swing motion of a slung load by approximately 30%. The mechatronic modules can be coupled and decoupled by special maneuvers of the UAV, and the intelligent global mission planner coordinates the operations of the UAV and the mechatronic modules for synchronous and seamless actions. For navigation in the vicinity of wind turbine blades, a visual-based localization merged with the location knowledge from Global Navigation Satellite System has been developed. A proof-of-concept system was field tested on a full-size decommissioned wind-turbine blade. The results show that the experimental system is able to deploy and retrieve a robotic payload onto and from a wind turbine blade safely and robustly without the need for human intervention. The vicinity localization and navigation system have shown an accuracy of 0.65 and 0.44 m in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Furthermore, this study shows the feasibility of systems toward autonomous inspection and maintenance of offshore windfarms. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {With the increase in demand for renewable energy and high maintenance costs caused by equipment and parts failure, the need for advanced monitoring technologies in this field is essential. Of specific concern are the frequent failures of wind turbine blades due to occasional inspections using conventional techniques and slow maintenance. One of the important steps to address these concerns and reach autonomy is to use drones to detect the wind turbine for inspection. This becomes crucial when the drone must fly a long distance to reach the wind turbine or wind farm. More specifically, as the drone is reaching the vicinity of the wind turbine, real-time GPS information may not necessarily lead the drone to reach right in front of the desired turbine. To resolve these issues, we use support vector machines (SVM) to classify the wind turbine images from those images that do not contain the wind turbine. The implemented SVM as a machine learning model is further enhanced by various hyperparameter tuning methods to ensure the highest accuracy possible. Default hyperparameters, RandomSearch, and Bayesian Optimization with Hyperband tuning are used, and the accuracies vs training times are compared. The proposed model can be ultimately used in an automated system using a drone and aerial images to detect the wind turbine for blade inspection. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low size, weight, and power (SWaP) fixed-wing UAVs are used in many applications, including search and rescue, surveillance, and tracking. To carry out these operations efficiently, there is a need to develop scalable, decentralized autonomous UAV network architectures with high network connectivity. However, the area coverage and the network connectivity requirements exhibit a fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we design a connectivity-aware pheromone mobility model using a deep Q-learning policy (CAP-DQN). We use stigmergy-based digital pheromone maps along with distance-based local connectivity information to autonomously coordinate the UAV movements in order to improve its map coverage efficiency while maintaining high network connectivity. The DQN policy helps in tuning and improving the coverage and connectivity trade-off. The proposed model facilitates efficient coverage and strong inter-UAV connectivity in autonomous UAV networks.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work presents the nonlinear dynamical model and motion controller of a system consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is tethered to a floating buoy in the three-dimensional (3D) space. Detailed models of the UAV, buoy, and the coupled tethered system dynamics are presented in a marine environment that includes surface water currents and oscillating gravity waves, in addition to wind gusts. This work extends the previously modeled planar (vertical) motion of this novel robotic system to allow its free motion in all three dimensions. Furthermore, a directional surge velocity control system (DSVCS) is proposed to allow both the free movement of the UAV around the buoy when the cable is slack, and the manipulation of the buoy’s surge velocity when the cable is taut. Using a spherical coordinates system centered at the buoy, the control system commands the UAV to apply forces on the buoy at specific azimuth and elevation angles via the tether, which yields a more appropriate realization of the control problem as compared to the Cartesian coordinates, where the traditional x-, y-, and z-coordinates do not intuitively describe the tether’s tension and orientation. The proposed robotic system and controller offer a new method of interaction and collaboration between UAVs and marine systems from a locomotion perspective, and offers a low-cost and low-logistics alternative to crewed vessels for marine missions. It has potential applications in search-and-rescue missions, monitoring and sensing operations, and floating objects manipulation and retrieval. The system is validated in a virtual high-fidelity simulation environment, which was specifically developed for this work, while considering various settings, operating conditions, and wave scenarios. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with ultra-dense sensors are crucial for several industries, such as smart agricultural systems deployed in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). The WSNs employ multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from multiple sensor nodes (SNs) and relay it to the central controller for processing. UAVs also provide resources to SNs and extend the network coverage over a vast geographical area. The O-RAN allows the use of open standards and interfaces to create a wireless network for communications between the UAVs and ground SNs. It enables real-time data transfer, remote control, and other applications that require a reliable and high-speed connection by providing flexibility and reliability for UAV-assisted WSNs to meet the requirements of smart agricultural applications. However, the limited battery life of UAVs, transmission power, and shortage of energy resources SNs make it difficult to collect all the data and relay it to the base station, resulting in inefficient task computation and resource management in smart agricultural systems. In this paper, we propose a joint UAV task scheduling, trajectory planning, and resource-sharing framework for multi-UAV-assisted WSNs for smart agricultural monitoring scenarios that schedule UAVs&#x0027; charging, data collection, and landing times and allow UAVs to share energy with SNs. The main objective of our proposed framework is to minimize the UAV energy consumption and network latency for effective data collection within a specific time frame. We formulate the multi-objective, which is a non-convex optimization problem, and transform it into a Markov decision process (MDP) with a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed MADRL algorithm reduces the energy consumption cost when compared to deep Q-network, Greedy, and mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by 61.92&#x0025;, 68.02&#x0025;, and 69.9&#x0025;, respectively.

	abstract = {In this paper, we plan to use ground-based stations in mobile edge computing (MEC) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide communication and computation offloading services in disaster areas. However, optimizing the initial number and three-dimensional position of deployed UAVs is a prerequisite for providing computing services to users. Additionally, due to the limited battery and computing power of UAVs, it is a major challenge to rationally design the UAV trajectory during the computational offloading period to ensure communication quality for mobile users and reduce the energy consumption for completing tasks. Thus, we propose a cooperative computation offloading strategy with on-demand deployment of multi-UAV in UAV-aided MEC. The strategy utilizes the predicted user trajectory for UAV deployment on the premise of the minimum path loss of users. Then, to minimize total energy consumption for completing tasks, a joint optimization problem comprising user association strategy, computing resource allocation strategy, and UAV trajectory is proposed, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Therefore, to find the suboptimal solution, we use the block coordinate descent method to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce the path loss by up to 18.55% and the total energy consumption by 18.28% compared to the benchmarks. IEEE},

	abstract = {Powertrain electrification in the agricultural vehicles is still in the initial stages. This article analyzes the energy behavior of a Photovoltaic/Fuel Cell Agricultural Mobile Robot (PV/FCAMR) as the preliminary step before development. This concept incorporates three energy storage sources for the powertrain: a battery pack, a Fuel Cell (FC) system, and a Photovoltaic (PV) system. This paper proposes an approach based on the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to determine the sizes of the FC and battery of an FCAMR. A differential drive mobile robot was used as a case study to extract the typical working cycles of farming applications. The FCAMR vehicle model was developed in MATLAB/Simulink to evaluate vehicle energy consumption and performance. For the energy analysis and evaluation, the FCAMR was tested based on two realistic working cycles comprising circular and rectangular moving patterns. The results showed that the proposed arrangement could extend the FCAMR autonomy by 350% as opposed to the pure electric system. This allows for at least 8 h of work with a tank filled with 150 g hydrogen and a PV system with a 0.5 m (Formula presented.) monocrystalline solar panel. The simulation results have demonstrated the relevance and robustness of this approach in relation to various working cycles. The cost comparison between the theoretical and optimization sizing methods showed at least an 8% decrease for the FCAMR. Furthermore, adding the PV system extended the vehicle’s range by up to 5%. This study provides an optimal solution for energy sources sizing of mobile robots as futuristic agricultural vehicles. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Several use cases already proposed for 5G networks cannot be facilitated by terrestrial infrastructure, either due to its small penetration in remote/rural areas or the harsh propagation conditions due to the terrain. Indicative applications include forestry, mining, agriculture, semi-autonomous control of long-range vehicles, industrial services, logistics, asset tracking, telemedicine, beyond visual-line-of-sight drone operations, and maritime insurance. Hence, such use cases necessitate the integration of terrestrial with non-terrestrial networks, which gives rise to several challenges to overcome. The project ETHER aims to provide a holistic approach for energy- and cost-efficient integrated terrestrial-non-terrestrial networks. To achieve this goal, ETHER develops solutions for a unified Radio Access Network and for Artificial Intelligence-enabled resource management across the terrestrial, aerial, and space domains while creating the business plans driving future investments. To that end, this paper discusses a series of key technologies that ETHER combines under a unique 3-Dimensional (3D) multi-layered architectural proposition that brings together: i) user terminal antenna design and implementation for direct handheld access in the integrated network, ii) a robust unified waveform, iii) energy-efficient seamless horizontal and vertical handover policies, iv) a zero-touch network/service management and orchestration framework, v) a flexible payload system to enable programmability in the aerial and space layers, vi) joint communication, compute, and storage resource allocation solutions targeting at end-to-end network performance optimisation leveraging novel predictive analytics, and vii) energy-efficient semantics-aware information handling techniques combined with edge computing and caching for reduced latency across the distributed 3D compute/storage continuum.

Aiming at the identification of potential landing sites, an end-to-end state estimation method for the autonomous landing of carrier-based UAVs based on monocular vision is proposed in this paper, which allows them to discover landing sites in flight by using equipped optical sensors and avoid a crash or damage during normal and emergency landings. This scheme aims to solve two problems: the requirement of accuracy for runway detection and the requirement of precision for UAV state estimation. First, we design a robust runway detection framework on the basis of YOLOv5 (you only look once, ver. 5) with four modules: a data augmentation layer, a feature extraction layer, a feature aggregation layer and a target prediction layer. Then, the corner prediction method based on geometric features is introduced into the prediction model of the detection framework, which enables the landing field prediction to more precisely fit the runway appearance. In simulation experiments, we developed datasets applied to carrier-based UAV landing simulations based on monocular vision. In addition, our method was implemented with help of the PyTorch deep learning tool, which supports the dynamic and efficient construction of a detection network. Results showed that the proposed method achieved a higher precision and better performance on state estimation during carrier-based UAV landings. © 2022 by the authors.},

UAV platforms also have capacity to improve the 3D positional precision of IoT networks, serving as aerial anchor nodes. In particular, UAV-assisted relaying is able to serve existing networks by enabling communication between two nodes suffering from blockages and by recovering the network in inaccessible disaster effected areas. In this chapter, we have observed scenario of UAV data gathering from sensor network, where each sensor scavenges energy from the data-collective UAV for its own information transmission; namely, after harvesting UAV energy by sensor nodes in second time instant UAV collects their data. In order to consider the possibility of the emergence of obstacles, which could block the line-of-sight (LOS) link among sensor nodes and UAV, and to remark the fluctuations of the LOS signal introduced by shadowing effect, we have premised Rician-shadowed fading channels model and analyzed the outage probability (OP) properties of such scenario. Rapidly converging infinite-series expression is provided for OP, and OP characteristics are observed and considered in the function of system parameters such as severity level of shadowing, target information rate, UAV coordinates, and the time ratio of wireless energy transfer (WET). Furthermore, communication in Hoyt fading environment has been observed, since it represents generalization of Rayleigh fading environment, most widely used non-LOS case scenario model. Closed-form expression for OP of the wireless sensor network (WSN) in Hoyt fading environment has been delivered. Also, the time allocation of downlink and uplink to minimize end-to-end OP subjected to UAV’s power profile. The impact of the target information rate and outage OP acceptable for required quality of service (QoS) and UAV’s hovering location is investigated. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The Wind Farms (WFs) are located far away from the load centres, with the resultant equivalent reactance being more than near the load. It results in a weak grid due to high power transferred in the transmission lines that affect the low frequency of oscillations, and the system exists with undamped functions. The transmission line has to be compensated to transmit wind power effectively. The Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) connects WF and the load centre. This work demonstrates a Power Oscillation Damper (POD) to WFs and SSSC for transmission lines and their combination. The eigenvalue of the damping ratio and frequency of oscillations are considered objective functions for particle swarm optimization and formulated based on stability to optimize the controller parameter for improving stability. The coordination between the POD and SSSC has been conducted using a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to further enhance system performance. The small signal and transient stability examinations use eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulation. It is analysed by varying the length (km) of the transmission line between the WF and the load centre, along with variation in wind penetration. The study observed that small signal stability damped the oscillatory modes most effectively. It is also revealed that the controller's combination with FLC intensifies the capability under extreme disturbances and detects an improvement in the system’s transient stability. The proposed approaches’ effectiveness is evaluated on an IEEE-11 bus two-area test system with optimized controller gain parameters and controller coordinated FLC through a Real-Time Digital Simulator. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising solution for aerial surveillance applications, such as traffic monitoring, disaster management, and infrastructure inspection. However, in urban environments, ground-based obstructions frequently disrupt the line-of-sight (LoS) links between the UAV and ground users (GUs), which leads to significant performance degradation in video streaming transmission. To enhance air-to-ground (A2G) communication quality, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can be employed to construct reconfigurable UAV-IRS-GU links. In this paper, we present a novel framework that integrates an IRS with a multi-antenna UAV to enable high-quality aerial video streaming service for a group of GUs simultaneously. By jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, operation time, transmit beamforming, and phase shifts, the total energy consumption of the UAV is minimized while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements for video streaming. The problem is formulated as an intractable non-convex optimization problem with closely coupled variables. To tackle such a challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. The first stage focuses on minimizing the UAV&#x2019;s propulsion energy consumption through path discretization, alternating optimization (AO), and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The second stage focuses on communication energy minimization, achieved through a double-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty-based block coordinate descent (P-BCD) technique. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show significant energy savings compared to several baseline schemes. IEEE},

	abstract = {The requirements of sustainable and fuel-efficient next-generation air transportation place greater demands on future aircraft design. Distributed electric propulsion (DEP) and twin-fuselage (TF) are promising concepts to improve aircraft aerodynamic efficiency and flight performance. This paper aims to develop a multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) framework for the TF DEP aircraft concept to investigate the potential of introducing these two technologies in improving aircraft energy efficiency. The most important effect modeled in this study is the influence of the boundary-layer-ingesting DEP system on the propulsive efficiency. Besides, analytical models are derived for the mass, aerodynamic, and performance analysis, separately. Design cases of a wing-segment-mounted DEP, and a TF DEP unmanned aerial vehicle are analyzed to investigate the design space of DEP parameters and to demonstrate the MDAO process. The results show that the best arrangement of the DEP is to distribute the propulsors evenly on the three wing segments of the wing divided by the two fuselages. The optimization leads to more than a 65% increment in the endurance and an 8% reduction in the takeoff mass of the exemplary aircraft. © 2022, AIAA International. All rights reserved.},

At first, the tasks are distributed for each agent based on the proximity of an agent to tasks, inter-task proximity, and task completion overhead. The assigned tasks of each agent are then orchestrated as the traveling salesman problem. A swap-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for optimizing the sequence of executions of the assigned tasks of each agent.

	abstract = {Responding to the global call for sustainable renewable energy sources amidst growing energy demands, exhaustion of fossil fuels, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, this study introduces a multi-objective optimization of an islanded green energy system. The focus is on the implementation of a sophisticated hybrid metaheuristic approach in a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) specifically designed for a university campus in Turkey. The developed HRES combines an array of technologies, including Photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, batteries, diesel generators, and inverters. One of the novel aspects of our work is the deployment of a rule-based Energy Management Scheme for effectively orchestrating the power flow between different system components. We employed various algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and a novel hybrid of the Firefly and PSO algorithms (HFAPSO) to ensure optimal sizing of HRES. This proves critical for achieving a cost-effective system that can meet specific load demands and adhere to techno-economic indicators. Our study employed four distinct scenarios, with the optimal scenario being met through PV/Battery components. Our approach effectively addressed the high Total Gas Emissions (TGE) observed in scenarios 3 and 4, leading to uninterrupted annual load coverage with zero TGE and 100% renewable energy, akin to scenario 1. The simulation results demonstrate the supremacy of the HFAPSO algorithm in sizing HRES. This approach proved more effective than the HOMERPPro software tool, as well as the GA, FA, and PSO algorithms. In addition, a comparative analysis of the time performances of these algorithms highlighted the superior performance and convergence of HFAPSO. The application of the HFAPSO algorithm in the most efficient system configuration resulted in 2787.341 kW PV and 3153.940 kW Battery. This led to an annual system cost (ACS) of $ 479340.57, a net present cost (NPC) of $ 7777668.32, and an energy cost of $ 0.2201 per kWh. The system, entirely covered by solar panels, achieved a Renewable Energy Fraction (REF) of 100%.This study highlights the potential of efficient utilization and management of renewable energy sources through multi-objective optimization. Our method provides a valuable solution for reliably meeting energy demands and minimizing the annual cost of energy systems. The optimization was programmed using the MATLAB simulation package. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When it comes to disaster rescue, quickly and accurately locating the trapped people will not miss the golden rescue time, thereby improving the success rate of rescue. The existing research has focused on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to locate stationary user equipment (UE). However, the simultaneous movement of the UAVs and the UE brings about problems of UAV coordinate deviation and range interference, resulting in poor accuracy and stability of UE localization. To solve the mentioned issues above, a fusion localization method based on multi-UAV collaborative ranging and user-side inertial measurement unit (IMU) module was proposed for GNSS-denied scenarios. First, the initial coordinate deviations of the UAVs were corrected by multi-UAV collaboration; Then, a pre-processing scheme based on density peaks clustering (DPC) was proposed to eliminate the abnormal interference in the ranging data; Finally, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was used to realize the fusion localization based on multi-UAV ranging and user-side IMU module. The simulation results showed that the proposed scheme can maintain the accuracy and stability of UE localization in the presence of ranging interference, and the positioning error was reduced by 21.4% compared with the commonly used extended Kalman filter (EKF). Moreover, the proposed localization scheme had a better performance in low-altitude rather than high-altitude flight scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The water-energy crisis seriously affects the sustainable development of China's steel industry chain. To achieve a coordinated development new path from the perspective of circular economy, it is necessary to analyze “water-energy-economy” dependency relationship of the steel products. This study analyzes a variety of steel products from the perspective of industry chain and simulates the “water-energy-economy” potential changes of products under different scenarios by developing a multi-objective optimization model. In this model, Random Forest (RF) and GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of trees (GEINIE3) algorithms are combined to evaluate the 2013–2019 “water-energy-economy” dependency relationships firstly. Then, improved Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied to dynamically simulate potential changes of water, energy and economic performance in the steel industry chain under different scenarios, and to design an optimal development path from the perspective of optimizing economic performance within minimum water and minimum energy use constraints. Results firstly point out the current “water-energy-economy” triple dimension dependency relationship of China's steel industry is weak. Secondly, the “water-economy” dependence has changed from one-way dependence to two-way dependence, and the “energy-economy” relationship still shows a one-way dependence. Finally, when improving resource utilization rate, assigning priority to the reuse of scrap steel, while restricting pig iron and primary steel use, may help maximize the coordinated development of “water-energy-economy” in the steel industry chain. Policy implications are proposed based on the results and provided decision-making basis for the country and relevant enterprises to promote sustainable development of the steel industry chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents a state-of-the-art tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (TUAV) for structural integrity assessment of underground stone mine pillars. The TUAV, powered by its tether, works in tandem with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that hosts the TUAV batteries, a self-leveled landing platform, and the tether management system. The UGV and the TUAV were named Rhino and Oxpecker, respectively, given that the TUAV stays landed on the UGV while the ensemble moves inside a mine. The mission of Oxpecker is to create, using a LiDAR sensor, 3D maps of the mine pillars to support time-lapse hazard mapping and time-dependent pillar degradation analysis. Given the height of the pillars (7–12 (Formula presented.)), this task cannot be executed by Rhino alone. This paper describes the drone’s hardware and software. The hardware includes the tether management system, designed to control the tension of the tether, and the tether perception system, which provides information that can be used for localization and landing in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-denied environments. The vehicle’s software is based on a state machine that controls the several phases of a mission (i.e., takeoff, inspection, and landing) by coordinating drone motion with the tethering system. The paper also describes and evaluates our approach for tether-based landing and autonomous 3D mapping of pillars. We show experiments that illustrate and validate our system in laboratories and underground mines. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The ability to control a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with minimal human intervention open new areas for autonomous UAV and drone applications. These applications include collaborative crop monitoring, aerial transportation, offshore delivery, facility monitoring, disaster relieve as well as search and rescue. Current UAV operations are heavily dependent on human operators that require each UAV to be controlled by dedicated safety pilot as well as a separate payload operator which limits the efficient use of UAVs required in envisaged swarm applications. Thus, there is an imperative to mature high autonomy guidance and navigation technologies to allow UAV swarm operations. This paper explores UAV swarm navigation and control strategies that allow higher levels of autonomy for a reliable UAV swarm operation. This paper presented the novel strategies developed in performing simultaneous swarm mapping, swarm search, and swarm path planning. The methods developed can be easily scaled up or down to adapt to different number of UAVs in a swarm for any application. The developed strategies are implemented and tested with Monte-Carlo simulations for a search and rescue type mission. The results from these simulation experiments have shown comparable achievements on the performance and robustness when compared to optimal control strategy. © 2023 IEEE.},

However, various limitations such as the battery capacity, the charging method, and the flying range make it difficult for most applications to carry out routine tasks in vast areas. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for multi-UAV path planning that considers a cooperative action amongst UAVs in which they share the next destination to avoid visiting the same location at the same time. The Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) enables UAVs to autonomously plan their fastest path and ensure the continuity of the mission by deciding when to schedule a visit to a charging station or a data collection point. An objective function with a tailored reward is designed to maintain the stability of the model and ensure the quick convergence of the model. Lastly, the proposed strategy has been demonstrated by the experiments on different scenarios and showed its effectiveness in ensuring the continuity of the mission with a fastest path possible.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Because the navigation errors of inertial navigation system accumulate with time, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation that only relies on inertial navigation system for positioning cannot obtain precision navigation information in long time flight. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a cooperative navigation scheme for master-slave UAV formation. First, the UAV is equipped with relative navigation sensors to measure the relative velocity and position information between the members of the master-slave UAV formation. Then, considering the relative pose of formation members, the spatial unified transformation scheme is studied. The absolute navigation information measured by each member of UAV formation by inertial navigation system and the relative navigation information measured by relative sensors is unified into the same navigation coordinate system. Finally, a cooperative navigation scheme based on relative velocity and relative position assistance is given. The 30 min simulation results show that the speed and position errors of each cluster converge to 0.1 m/s and 5 m respectively under this scheme, which is more suitable than the inertial navigation system. © 2022 Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

	abstract = {Stable energy networks are vital for the transmission and distribution of various forms of energy, and their efficient and sustainable management is crucial in meeting the growing demands of the modern world. Self-organizing applications appear to enable efficient management and optimization of energy systems [1]. Self-organisation allow components of the network to communicate and cooperate without relying on centralized control [8], leveraging real-time data analysis and decision-making to adapt to changing conditions. However, implementing self-organizing applications in energy grids comes with challenges [3]. Developing robust and scalable algorithms to coordinate and optimize network behavior is complex, considering dynamic environments, large-scale data, and varying energy source constraints. The planned thesis aims to explore the potential of swarm intelligence, inspired by slime mold behavior, in developing self-organizing applications for energy grids. It investigates the benefits and limitations of self-organizing applications compared to centralized control systems and explores how nature-inspired approaches can be combined with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to optimize energy networks. The hypothesis that nature-inspired approaches can be combined with artificial intelligence is supported, for example, by Tran et al. in [12] and Khan et al. in [6].

	abstract = {In recent years, enhancing intelligence in the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with a decrease in cost for the application of swarm fleets has attracted a variety of interest. Specifically, for urban applications such as public transportation, logistics mobilization, rescue operations, etc., there is a need for a fleet of UAVs to plan and coordinate intelligently without human intervention. A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that can learn and make policies for such systems is desperately needed. This paper proposes an AI-based Bio-inspired Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (B-DMARL) framework as a multi-agent actor-critic model for executing an assigned job in an increasingly dynamic environment. The B-DMARL is a distributed control architecture with two levels. For group coordination and collision avoidance, low-level control is developed using an AI-based bio-inspired steering behavior algorithm. Using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning method, the agent is trained as a high-level control to correctly execute tasks in more dynamic environments. In a virtual simulation environment, the proposed B-DMARL framework is applied to persistent surveillance tasks that require the cooperation and collaboration of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods have an improved learning rate and reward signal. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {To enlarge the application of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and the future service-driven U-space for automated and autonomous air traffic, the SESAR PJ34-W3 AURA project investigates the concept of a shared airspace between U-space and controlled airspace. Part of this concept is a dynamically reconfigurable airspace based on the demands of both traditional aviation and UAS, especially in areas of high demand or at the boundaries of these airspaces.This paper discusses the flight testing of a dynamic airspace reconfiguration in an airport environment during a runway inspection operation using a camera-equipped drone. To this aim, a drone mission along the runway has been planned and conducted at the Magdeburg-Cochstedt Airport, now serving as National Experimental Test Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).The described flight testing was part of a joint exercise of DLR and The Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR), in which the impact of UAS emergencies on air traffic controllers has been under investigation. To that aim, air traffic controllers in The Netherlands were managing simulated inbound and outbound traffic at Rotterdam The Hague airport. A portion of the airspace along the runway has been assigned to a virtual U-space environment to enable a simulated runway inspection. As the baseline scenario, a drone flight along the planned part of the runway and back to the launch area has been conducted. In a second flight, an emergency landing of the drone on the runway due to a malfunction has been performed to investigate the impact of such a contingency on air traffic controllers. This contingency resulted in a temporal extension of the U-space portion of the airspace, and required suitable actions from the air traffic controllers, such as diversion or holding of arriving and departing manned air traffic.The paper describes the use case for the drone mission, and the preparations at the exercise site due to described differences and restrictions. The particularities of the communication between exercise participants is under investigation, such as transfer of the required data to be displayed in the simulation environment, and the necessities to organize, conduct and harmonize the activities at remote locations, i.e. Germany and The Netherlands. Further, the coordinate transformation and the matching of the airport environments is described. The exercise conduction and impressions from the respective working positions are presented. The paper concludes with highlighting the benefits of such a flight trial in this context, and provides initial solutions for challenges that have been encountered during the trials. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In post-disaster situations, search and rescue operations are actively supported by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology. As it is well known, UAV-based monitoring services require computational effort for in-network processing, which drones cannot easily support. This gives rise to the need to offload tasks to available and nearby network segments. However, the disruption caused by natural disasters often renders networks and services unavailable and unreachable. While some recent scientific contributions have already explored the idea of offloading computing tasks to support network elements in post-disaster situations, there is still a need to formulate a lightweight approach aimed at dynamically selecting suitable, trusted, and available network segments for in-network processing. In line with these premises, a novel service orchestration scheme for selecting the most suitable domain to offload processing tasks generated by drones is presented. Precisely, the conceived scheme addresses the domains affected by natural disasters and replaces them with available network segments for in-network processing, leveraging the Network Digital Twin representation. The adopted strategy employs a lightweight multi-criteria decision-making methodology to jointly consider the quality of service and trustworthiness parameters of the domains crossed by a drone. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is investigated through computer simulations. The obtained results demonstrate that the conceived approach offers up to 75.61% service availability for in-network processing compared to baseline techniques.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {­ The exploration of unknown environments can be beneficial for a variety of applications, such as inspection of industrial equipment, environmental monitoring, or search and rescue missions. In order to tackle this problem, swarm robotics has emerged as a promising approach due to its ability to leverage the collective behavior of a group of robots to explore an area efficiently. This paper proposes a swarm­based control algorithm for exploration and coverage of unknown environments. The algorithm utilizes short­range distributed communication and sensing among agents, with no central unit, to coordinate the swarm’s navigation and search tasks. This sensing is prioritized in the outermost agents of the swarm to reduce processing and energy costs, and these positions can be rotated with other agents in the swarm. The formation rules that keep the system cohesive are simple and independent of the individual robot characteristics, enabling the use of heterogeneous agents. The performance of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through experiments in coverage and search tasks, and compared with other swarm strategies. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for exploration and coverage of unknown environments. The research presented in this paper has the potential to contribute to the development of more efficient and effective swarm­based exploration and coverage strategies. © 2023, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

	abstract = {FASTER is an H2020 research project, within the European framework, in which Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams, in addition to other first responders, conduct an on-theground assessment of latest support technologies. These technologies are to be used in victim rescue response situations well as for coordination and safety procedures between disaster responders in diverse types of catastrophe scenarios. The tools have been developed by technical partners of the FASTER project committee and, with the aim of assessing the tools, two pilot exercises were conducted in collapsed buildings in Spain, simulating the impact of two earthquakes. The objective is to integrate and adapt the FASTER tools in initial interventions during the search for and rescue of victims. The focus is placed on information gathering in the disaster area, among other aspects. Simulation exercises were conducted in real locations involving collapsed buildings using drones, unmanned vehicles, canine wearables, a mobile command centre, a weather station and social network analysis, with real people acting the part of victims together with human dummy figures. Through these exercises, an assessment was carried out of the acceptability, ease of use, applicability, efficiency, and effectiveness of FASTER technology. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic during the implementation of various pilot exercises was a setback that led us to introduce a USAR Camp deployment procedure involving preventive anti-COVID-19 measures, in accordance with the recommendations of official organisations such as INSARAG and the WHO. © 2023 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Key Laboratory of Quantitative Remote Sensing in Agriculture of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Information Technology Research Center, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing 100097, China,Abstract：Acquiring the plant nitrogen content (PNC) information of crops quickly and accurately is the key to agricultural meticulous management and a research hotspot in the development of digital agriculture. In recent years, with the development of UAV and sensor technology, the use of various sensor information to monitor the physical and chemical parameters of crops has gradually attracted the attention of scholars at home and abroad. This study takes potato as the research object. Firstly, based on the UAV, the hyperspectral images and digital images of the potato budding stage, tuber formation stage, tuber growth stage, starch accumulation stage and maturity stage were obtained. At the same time, the digital camera was used to synchronously obtain the ground digital images of five growth periods, and the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of eleven ground control points (GCPs) and plant height (H), PNC were measured. Secondly, the digital surface model (DSM) of the test area was generated by using UAV digital images combined with GCPs. The accuracy of the extracted VCuav and Hdsm is verified by the calculated coverage (VC) of the digital image and the measured H. Then, the green edge parameters (GEPs) were calculated according to the hyperspectral images, and four fusion feature parameters (FFPs) of GEPs×Hdsm∗VCuav, GEPs/(1+VCuav), (GEPs+VCuav)×Hdsm and GEPs/(1+Hdsm) were constructed, fusion of hyperspectral image information and digital image information. Finally, the correlation between GEPs extracted and FFPs constructed in each growth period with PNC were analyzed, and the PNC linear estimation models of five growth periods were constructed based on the optimal GEP and optimal FFP respectively. According to the GEPs and FFPs with high correlation, the multiple parameters estimation models of PNC were constructed by using partial least squares (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The results show that: (1) Hdsm and VCuav extracted from UAV digital images have high accuracy , which can replace the measured H and VC to estimation physical and chemical parameters (2) Compared with GEPs, most of the constructed FFPs have stronger correlation with PNC in the first four growth stages, and could better reflect the nitrogen nutrition status of potato. (3) Linear estimation models of potato PNC were constructed based on the optimal green edge parameter (OGEP) and the optimal fusion feature parameter (OFFP), respectively. The results showed that the effect of OFFP in estimating PNC was better than that of OGEP. (4) Compared with the single-parameter model, the accuracy and stability of the model constructed by using PLSR and ANN based on GEPs and FFPs are significantly improved. Among them, the models constructed with FFPs as the model factor have the best effect. (5) The ANN method is better than the PLSR method in estimating PNC in each growth period. Therefore, the fusion of the hyperspectral green edge parameters and the plant height and coverage information extracted by the high-definition digital camera sensor can improve the estimation accuracy of PNC, which provide a reference for the non-destructive dynamic monitoring of potato nitrogen nutrition status and the application of multi-source sensors information. © 2022 Science Press.

	abstract = {Disaster areas involving floods and earthquakes are commonly large, with the rescue time being quite tight, suggesting multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) exploration rather than employing a single UAV. For such scenarios, current UAV exploration is modeled as a Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem to achieve full area coverage in the presence of obstacles. However, the UAV's endurance capability is limited, and the rescue time is constrained, prohibiting even multiple UAVs from completing disaster area coverage on time. Therefore, this paper defines a multi-Agent Endurance-limited CPP (MAEl-CPP) problem that is based on an a priori known heatmap of the disaster area, which affords to explore the most valuable areas under UAV limited energy constraints. Furthermore, we propose a path planning algorithm for the MAEl-CPP problem by ranking the possible disaster areas according to their importance through satellite or remote sensing aerial images and completing path planning according to this ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that the search efficiency of the proposed algorithm is 4.2 times that of the existing algorithm. © 2022 IEEE.},

The UAV locations are tailored to end-user locations and service needs while ensuring that UAVs maintain localized backhaul connectivity.

	abstract = {In the context of frequent public emergencies, emergency logistics distribution is particularly critical, and because of the unique advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the model of coordinated delivery of vehicles and UAVs is gradually becoming an essential form of emergency logistics distribution. However, the omission of start-up costs prevents the cost of UAV battery replacement and the sorting, assembly and verification of packages from being factored into the total cost. Furthermore, most existing models focus on route optimization and delivery cost, which cannot fully reflect the customer’s desire for service satisfaction under emergency conditions. It is necessary to convert the unsatisfactory degree of time window into a penalty cost rather than a model constraint. Additionally, there is a lack of analysis on the mutual waiting cost between vehicles and UAVs when one of them is performing delivery tasks. Considering the effects of the time window, customer demand, maximum load capacity, and duration of distribution benefits, we propose a collaborative delivery path optimization model for vehicles and UAVs to minimize the total distribution cost. A genetic algorithm is used to obtain the model solution under the constraints of distribution subloops, distribution order, and take-off and landing nodes. To assess the efficacy of the vehicle and UAV collaborative delivery path optimization model, this paper employs a county-level district in Xi’an city as a pilot area for an emergency delivery. Compared with the vehicle-alone delivery model, the UAV-alone delivery model and vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model, this model can significantly reduce the utilization of distribution vehicles while also significantly lowering the start-up cost, waiting cost and penalty cost. Thus, the model can effectively improve delivery timeliness and customer satisfaction. The total cost of this model is 39.2% less than that of the vehicle-alone delivery model and 16.5% less than that of the UAV-alone delivery model. Although its delivery cost is slightly higher than the vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model, the reduction in the start-up cost and penalty cost decrease the overall cost of distribution by 11.8%. This suggests that to cut costs of all sizes and conserve half of the resources used by vehicles, employing the vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model for emergency distribution is preferable. Moreover, the model integrating the start-up cost, penalty cost, waiting cost, etc., can more effectively express the requirements of timeliness for UAV delivery under emergency conditions. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Swarm foraging is a common test case application for multi-robot systems. In this paper RepAtt algorithm is used for improving coordination of a robot swarm by selectively broadcasting repulsion and attraction signals. This is a chemotaxis-inspired search behaviour where robots use the temporal gradients of these signals to navigate towards more advantageous areas. Hardware experiments were used to model and validate realistic, noisy sound communication and vision system. We then show through extensive simulation studies that RepAtt significantly improves swarm foraging time and robot efficiency under realistic communication and vision models. Note to Practitioners - This research developed a swarm foraging algorithm that takes into consideration the vision and communication sensing noise levels faced by robots in real world applications. The algorithm, known as RepAtt, was developed with the aim of emphasizing algorithmic simplicity and limiting the hardware requirements for the robots in the swarm. In this paper, we have focused on the problem of deploying swarm robots to forage litter in an environment such as a park. The communication model of the robots was based on the physics of sound, while their vision system was modelled using experiments with deep neural networks based object detectors. The results show that the RepAtt algorithm is robust to different distributions of targets (or litter) in the search space, exhibits good swarm efficiency with changes in swarm population and is robust to noise in its communication and vision systems. Apart from the RepAtt algorithm, other contributions made by this research include modelling of robot vision system to aid extensive study of the impact of communication and vision noise on swarm coordination. This will be relevant for extensive testing and validation before deployment to swarm robots hardware. The sound communication used in this research limits the kinds of environment the robots can be deployed in. Echoes within an enclosed environment and bandwidth limitation for communication frequency and public disturbance due to sound emitted by the robots can all contribute to this limitation. Thus, this research can be improved by investing in the development of a communication technology with similar physics. Other areas of improvement include adopting better obstacle avoidance algorithms and implementing suitable manipulators for handling litter objects. The algorithm can be extended to make it applicable for solving other problems such as search and rescue operations where foraging targets could be disaster survivors; demining and hazardous waste cleanup, where targets are the mines or waste material; and planetary exploration, where targets could be interesting features of the planets are the targets searched for by the robots.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used in disaster recovery efforts to confirm the extent of the damage caused by a large-scale disaster and to ensure that adequate information about the affected area is gathered. UAV usage in a disaster situation is not limited to information gathering, but its functions further extend to network communication functions such as a communication relay, mobile base station, etc. Conversely, using UAVs as communication relays or base stations (e.g., as a temporary mobile base station) is subject to some limitations such as bad weather and limited energy, which affect the timely collection and delivery of information to and from a disaster area. Therefore, an approach to improve the information collection and delivery in a disaster area while ensuring urgent network restoration is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a practical approach to deploying a drone-based message ferry to improve the timely collection and delivery of information in a disaster situation. Specifically, a locally accessible cloud system (LACS), which we previously developed for urgent local network restoration in a disaster affected area, is attached to a drone to form a message ferry. In order to improve the information collection and delivery, the message ferry is deployed from the local headquarters (i.e., local government office or disaster response coordination center) to carry information to and from a standalone LACS installed at each disaster shelter. We measure the achievable data rate of inter-LACS data transfer (i.e., message ferry and a standalone LACS) through experiment. Thereafter, we estimate and confirm the effective transmission speed to transfer data from the local headquarters to the disaster shelters using average achievable data rate obtained from the experiment in order to extend the LACS services and functions. Our experimental results and analysis suggest that the proposed message ferry is more advantageous to transfer a large amount of data (e.g., 300 MB) at a high speed in the hundred meter to ten kilometer range. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The groundbreaking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology has gained significant attention from both academia and industrial experts due to several applications, such as military missions, power lines inspection, precision agriculture, remote sensing, delivery services, traffic monitoring and many more. UAVs are expected to become a mainstream delivery element by 2040 to address the ever‐increasing demand for delivery services. Similarly, UAV‐assisted monitoring approaches will automate the inspection process, lowering mission costs, increasing access to remote locations and saving time and energy. Despite the fact that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining popularity in both military and civilian applications, they have a number of limitations and critical problems that must be addressed in order for missions to be effective. One of the most difficult and time‐consuming tasks is charging UAVs. UAVs’ mission length and travel distance are constrained by their low battery endurance. There is a need to study multi‐UAV charging systems to overcome battery capacity limitations, allowing UAVs to be used for a variety of services while saving time and human resources. Wired and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems have emerged as viable options to successfully solve this difficulty. In the past, several research surveys have focused on crucial aspects of wireless UAV charging. In this review, we have also examined the most emerging charging techniques for UAVs such as laser power transfer (LPT), distributed laser charging (DLC), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and simultaneous light wave information and power transfer (SLIPT). The classification and types of UAVs, as well as various battery charging methods, are all discussed in this paper. We’ve also addressed a number of difficulties and solutions for safe operation.

While the majority of prior work focuses on the coordination and control of such multi-robot systems, to date, these UAV teams have not been given the ability to reason about a fire’s track (i.e., location and propagation dynamics) to provide performance guarantee over a time horizon. Motivated by the problem of aerial wildfire monitoring, we propose a predictive framework which enables cooperation in multi-UAV teams towards collaborative field coverage and fire tracking with probabilistic performance guarantee. Our approach enables UAVs to infer the latent fire propagation dynamics for time-extended coordination in safety-critical conditions. We derive a set of novel, analytical temporal, and tracking-error bounds to enable the UAV-team to distribute their limited resources and cover the entire fire area according to the case-specific estimated states and provide a probabilistic performance guarantee. Our results are not limited to the aerial wildfire monitoring case-study and are generally applicable to problems, such as search-and-rescue, target tracking and border patrol. We evaluate our approach in simulation and provide demonstrations of the proposed framework on a physical multi-robot testbed to account for real robot dynamics and restrictions. Our quantitative evaluations validate the performance of our method accumulating 7.5 × and 9.0 × smaller tracking-error than state-of-the-art model-based and reinforcement learning benchmarks, respectively. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {With the gradual establishment of regional cooperative air defense systems by the world’s military powers, the success rate of a single-aircraft penetration operation is greatly reduced, and the concept of many-to-one cooperative operation has been widely valued. As a new type of lethal aerial weapon, suicide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in many local wars recently. Compared with traditional missiles, suicide UAVs can hover in a combat area for a long time, waiting for potential targets. Moreover, a suicide UAV cannot be easily detected via an early warning system and can approach targets covertly. Further, the manufacturing cost of a suicide UAV is low, and it can form a large-scale swarm for a surprise attack. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, a multi-UAV cooperative attack is likely to subvert existing combat styles. According to the operational characteristics and requirements of multi-UAV cooperative attacks, a general guidance scheme for the cooperative attack of multi-UAVs is proposed. Based on the theory that proportional navigation law has trajectory uniqueness under specific variable constraints, the guidance phase is divided into coordination and terminal phases by selecting coordinated variables. The improved Dubins method is used in the track control of the coordination phase to realize the space–time synchronous convergence of coordination variables. The 3D space guidance is decoupled into longitudinal- and lateral-plane guidance in the terminal phase, and the impact time of the swarm is consistent based on the proportional guidance with the same coefficient. A track segment control realizes the space–time cooperation of the swarm considering the target defense range constraint. Numerical simulation and actual flight test results show that the scheme has real-time online planning ability, can realize an omnidirectional saturation attack under the space–time cooperation of a large-scale UAV swarm, and has high impact time and space precision. © 2022 Science Press.

	abstract = {Cloud has been developed as a prominent distributed computing model over the last few years because of its wide array of resources and services that are virtualized, scalable, and on demand. In a distributed environment, coordination of workflow applications is an accepted NP-complete problem; hence, it is hard to derive exact solutions. Because of its dynamic and heterogeneous properties, this happens to be even more difficult in cloud environment. The intention of this work is to improve multi-objective optimization of scientific workflow scheduling based on proposed multi-objective hybrid particle search optimization algorithm (MOHPSO) in cloud computing platform and to propose an effective framework for workflow execution. For initial stage, fuzzy Manhattan distance-based clustering is performed to cluster the cloud resources. After that, enhanced chaotic neural network technique is applied to encrypt the task details for security purpose.

	abstract = {The research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles assisted Mobile Edge Computing (UAV-assisted MEC) attracts more and more interests of researchers. Nowadays, MEC systems with multiple UAVs have great research value, especially for emergency communication scenarios. In this paper, a heterogeneous UAVs assisted MEC system was proposed, and with the goal of minimization the edge side energy consumption, a parallel processing was involved to jointly optimize the communication scheduling, forwarding power, offloading data size, computing frequency and the trajectory of the UAV. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP), hard to solve. Therefore, we divided the MINLP into two sub-problems by applying the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, and solved it using the Lagrangian Duality (LD) method and Successive Convex Optimization (SCO). The UAV's trajectory was initialized as a circular, and then it was optimized by using the standardized convex solver design algorithm. In addition, a heuristic algorithm was put forward to obtain the optimization solution, while we set other benchmarks and the Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to justify its validity and rationality. The simulation results showed that our strategy has better performance at minimizing energy consumption compared with other algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

In addition, the deployment of UAVs equipped with mobile-edge computing (MEC) servers to provide computing services at the edges of networks has become an emerging method. Under complex and limited resource constraints, increasing the total number of computation bits in the system becomes a challenging problem. Motivated by this, in this article, we propose an optimization framework to maximize the computation bits of the whole system by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, the task offloading time allocation, and the trajectory of the UAV under the energy constraints of ground devices (GDs) and the maximal battery energy of the UAV. The formulated problem is a nonconvex and nonconcave problem that is very difficult to solve. To this end, we decompose the objective function into three suboptimization problems and adopt successive convex optimization techniques to solve them. Then, we utilize the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to address the overall optimization problem. By doing so, the bandwidth allocation of GDs, task offloading time and local computing time allocation in each time slot, and the trajectory of the UAV are optimized alternately during each iteration. We conduct extensive simulations, and the results verify that the proposed solution achieves a better performance than those of other benchmark schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are implemented in many aspects of daily life, such as Internet of Things applications, industrial automation, and intelligent agriculture. Sensors are typically powered by batteries. Chargers can be used to supply power to sensor nodes and thus extend the lifetime of WSNs. This special type of network is named a wireless rechargeable sensor network (WRSN). However, due to the limited battery power and different deployment locations of the sensors, efficiently moving the chargers from the current sensor nodes to the next sensor nodes is a challenge. In this study, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based charging scheme in an urban bus system, involving the coordination between UAVs and bus schedules. The UAVs can be recharged by urban buses and then supply the power to sensor nodes. We implemented three charging strategies: naïve, shortest path, and max power. In the naïve strategy, the UAVs fly directly to sensor nodes when the sensors are lacking power. In the shortest path strategy, the minimum distance between the sensor node and bus location is calculated, and the UAVs fly the shortest path to the sensor nodes. In the maximum power charging strategy, the UAV that has the highest battery power is assigned to work. The experimental results show that the shortest path charging and max power charging strategies perform better than naïve charging in different parameter settings. To prolong the lifetime of the network system, adjusting the bus frequency according to the number of nearby sensors around the bus route is favorable. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The elevated demand for electrical power, expeditious expenditure of fossil fuels, and degradation of the environment because of power generation have renewed attentiveness to renewable energy resources (RER). The rapid augmentation of RER increases the convolutions in leveling the demand and generation of electrical power. In this paper, an elaborated α-constrained simplex method (ACSM) is recommended for multi-objective power dispatch problems. This methodology is devised after synthesizing the non-linear simplex method (SM) with the α-constrained method (ACM) and the evolutionary method (EM). ACSM can transfigure an optimization technique for the constrained problems by reinstating standard juxtapositions with α-level collations. The insertion of mutations and multi-simplexes can explore the periphery of the workable zone. It can also manage the fastness of convergence and therefore, the high precision solution can be obtained. A real-time multi-objective coordinated solar-wind-thermal power scheduling problem is framed. Two conflicting objectives (operating cost and emission) are satisfied. The case studies are carried out for Muppandal (Tamil Nadu), Jaisalmer (Rajasthan), and Okha (Gujarat), India. The annual solar and wind data are analyzed by using Normal Distribution and Weibull Distribution Density Factor, respectively. The presented technique is inspected on numerous archetype functions and systems. The results depict the prevalence of ACSM over particle swarm optimization (PSO), simplex method with mutations (SMM), SM, and EM. © 2022, the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

	abstract = {Achieving sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction and resource utilization are always a bottleneck for resource providers, especially when trying to meet the computing needs of resource hungry applications in mobile edge-cloud (MEC) continuum. Recent research uses metaheuristic techniques to allocate resources to large-scale applications in MECs. However, some challenges attributed to the metaheuristic techniques include entrapment at the local optima caused by premature convergence and imbalance between the local and global searches. These may affect resource allocation in MECs if continually implemented. To address these concerns and ensure efficient resource allocation in MECs, we propose a fruit fly-based simulated annealing optimization scheme (FSAOS) to serve as a potential solution. In the proposed scheme, the simulated annealing is incorporated to balance between the global and local search and to overcome its premature convergence. We also introduce a trade-off factor to allow application owners to select the best service quality that will minimize their execution cost. Implementation of the FSAOS is carried out on EdgeCloudSim Simulator tool. Simulation results show that the FSAOS can schedule resources effectively based on tasks requirement by returning minimum makespan and execution costs, and achieve better resource utilization compared to the conventional fruit fly optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization. To further unveil how efficient the FSAOSs, a statistical analysis based on 95% confidential interval is carried out. Numerical results show that FSAOS outperforms the benchmark schemes by achieving higher confidence level. This is an indication that the proposed FSAOS can provide efficient resource allocation in MECs while meeting customers’ aspirations as well as that of the resource providers. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the increasing availability of high-resolution satellite and drone images and the Internet of Things (IoT) has begun transforming remote sensing of agriculture by improving accessibility and frequency of updates. Modern IoT-based smart agriculture systems use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to gather information from an ecosystem that regulates the quantity of water in agricultural fields could be one of these activities. The WSNs remained a challenge to transfer data to drones for analysis purposes. These are composed of tiny sensory architectures organized together to bring efficiency and scalability features to a network. WSN nodes are controlled and managed by a cluster. It is quite difficult to design an efficient leader election protocol. The computation power, storage space, and energy supply of sensor nodes make them unable to frequently switch to a different cluster. The WSN cluster-head election process requires a lot of energy (evaluation and computational process to select the most appropriate node with the least impact on network fragmentation in energy consumption of selected node). Then it is necessary to formulate a mechanism where WSNs utilize the least energy to coordinate with the remote sensing sources. This study presents a cluster election algorithm using the fuzzy logic inference system. It uses a coordinates system to map network nodes and map them based on prioritized scheduling. Lifetime augmentation in wireless sensor networks has always been of great interest. During data transmission from normal sensor nodes to the base station (sink), excess energy is dissipated. Optimizing the energy dissipation of WSNs through the selection of cluster heads is a powerful way to increase the lifespan. By electing more efficient nodes as cluster heads, the proposed method extends the network's lifetime by reducing the number of unimportant communications between nodes. With the utilization of network resources efficiently, the network's lifetime is extended. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Structure) algorithm and FCA method based on the remaining energy and the number of active nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm utilizes less energy for communication with remote sensory equipment for intelligent agriculture. The performance of the method improved for remaining energy by 9%, the number of active nodes rate by 24%, and indirectly network resource utilization than other states of the art solutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The increase in the number of heavy precipitation events and drought periods due to climate change induce geohazards that significantly affect the economy and pose significant threats to the population. The coast is a particularly vulnerable territory, as it has been extensively modified by urban development mainly related to tourism. The RISKCOAST project is funded by the Interreg Sudoe Programme (Ref: SOE3/P4/E0868) that promotes innovation to face a set of threatens linked to climate change as landslides, soil erosion, floodings, beach retreating, erosion of sandy coasts and deltas regression. The project offers an integrated vision of the geohazards by taking into account, not only the coastal fringe but also the entire hydrological basin. RISKCOAST proposes a set of natural renovation measures adapted to every risk and territory; environmental protection measures with a minimum impact on ecosystems. For this purpose, RISKCOAST provides tools and strategies for more coordinated and efficient management of risks. These tools can be grouped in: (i) Geohazard Maps for supporting spatial planning and land-use. (ii) Tools based on the integrated study of fluvial and coastal dynamics and (3) Tools to support early warning systems. Geohazard Maps aims to obtain useful cartographic tools, and understandable to emergency administrators. In the second one, we propose a new methodology for the development of forecasting tools based on the integrated study of fluvial and coastal dynamics including the predictions of climate change scenarios. Finally, tools to support early warning systems will be based on different innovative techniques such as satellite and terrestrial DInSAR monitoring, drones, or on mathematical simulations based on spectral analysis and its results would be highly valuable for experts in dealing with safety. Tools and methods will be tested through participative simulacrums in the test-sites of RISKCOAST: Mallorca (Spain) and Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France). © 2022, National Technical University of Athens.

	abstract = {With the increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in various fields, the coordinated execution of tasks by multiple UAVs has become an important development trend in the future. To avoid the collision of multiple UAVs with each other during flight and ensure flight safety, it is essential to be able to achieve high-precision, real-time airborne UAV object detection. In this work, a UAV object detection method called Mob-YOLO is proposed. Based on the high-performance model YOLOv4, MobileNetv2, a lightweight convolutional neural network, is used to replace the original YOLOv4 backbone CSPDarknet53 for model size reduction and computing operation simplification. Meanwhile, to solve the issue of poor accuracy for small UAV objects after network replacement, this work also designs a multi-scale feature extraction and fusion branch to expand the receptive field of the object detector by multi-scale feature fusion. The proposed method is evaluated using a self-built UAV dataset. The results demonstrate that Mob-YOLO can satisfy accurate real-time monitoring of UAV objects, and the model size is tiny, which can be used for deployment on airborne embedded processors.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) devices in precision farming is more and more increasing due to the ease of this type of mechanism to traverse terrain, even those difficult to access, a UAV is implemented to optimize performances and monitor crop grow and production; however, these devices present flight issues as GPS signals blocked, decreased battery life, wrong direction and instability on air. For this reason, it is essential to carry out researches to improve the current deficiencies of UAVs, to improve their performance and their implementation in different applications for human assistance. The paper presents results obtained by the design of a control system capable of tracking trajectories built by implementing the A-star algorithm for Quadrotor-type drones. A system of two control techniques used in the tracking and positioning of a course, obtained by using the "A-star" algorithm, is constructed, and analyzed by using MATLAB® as a programming and simulation context. Thanks to the usage of these devices, the autonomy in precision farming systems is increased, generating greater effectiveness and profitability. It has been possible to conclude that the strategy studied in the research project increases the autonomy of the device and the capacity of data collection. In addition, it is an algorithm that does not require extra hardware. Also, its computational processing consumption depends only on the distance between the origin and target points. © 2022 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to their promising applications and intriguing characteristics, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be dispatched as flying base stations to serve multiple energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. Moreover, to ensure fresh data collection while providing sustainable energy support to a large set of IoT devices, a required number of UAVs should be deployed to carry out these two tasks efficiently and promptly. Indeed, the data collection requires that UAVs first make Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) to supply IoT devices with the necessary energy in the downlink. Then, IoT devices perform Wireless Information Transmission (WIT) to UAVs in the uplink based on the harvested energy. However, it turns out that when the same UAV performs WIT and WET, its energy usage and the data collection time are severely penalized. Worse yet, it is difficult to efficiently coordinate between UAVs to improve the performance in terms of WET and WIT. This work proposes to divide UAVs into two teams to behave as data collectors and energy transmitters, respectively. A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) method, called TEAM, is leveraged to jointly optimize both teams' trajectories, minimize the expected Age of Information (AoI), maximize the throughput of IoT devices, minimize the energy utilization of UAVs, and enhance the energy transfer. Simulation results depict that TEAM can effectively synchronize UAV teams and adapt their trajectories while serving a large-scale dynamic IoT environment.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have come in a great diversity of several applications such as military, construction, image and video mapping, medical, search and rescue, parcel delivery, hidden area exploration, oil rigs and power line monitoring, precision farming, wireless communication and aerial surveillance. The drone industry has been getting significant attention as a model of manufacturing, service and delivery convergence, introducing synergy with the coexistence of different emerging domains. UAVs offer implicit peculiarities such as increased airborne time and payload capabilities, swift mobility, and access to remote and disaster areas. Despite these potential features, including extensive variety of usage, high maneuverability, and cost-efficiency, drones are still limited in terms of battery endurance, flight autonomy and constrained flight time to perform persistent missions. Other critical concerns are battery endurance and the weight of drones, which must be kept low. Intuitively it is not suggested to load them with heavy batteries. This study highlights the importance of drones, goals and functionality problems. In this review, a comprehensive study on UAVs, swarms, types, classification, charging, and standardization is presented. In particular, UAV applications, challenges, and security issues are explored in the light of recent research studies and development. Finally, this review identifies the research gap and presents future research directions regarding UAVs. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Smart agriculture 4.0 has recently been implemented in Indonesia to enhance agricultural productivity through the use of advance technology. Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAVs) is one of the technologies that have been utilized in the agricultural sector to improve production quality and quantity. Although some advanced technology has been used, currently there are some challenges that remain to be solved to implement multi-UAV in the real environment. Some of these challenges include battery limitations in UAV and the long duration to queue at the charging station. To address this issue, a previous study has proposed Cloud Based Drone Navigation (CBDN) algorithm that can be employed to optimize multi-UAV coordination by selecting the best flight path for the UAV to reach a charging station. Such an approach has resulted in reducing the waiting time of UAVs to be charged. However, the algorithm has not considered swarm robot parameters. This study aims to analyze the use of CBDN algorithm with parameters derived from swarm robots. The performance of the CBDN algorithm will then be evaluated and compared to the Shortest Flight Time (SFT) and Individual Reservation Navigation System (IRN) algorithms as two benchmark algorithms, in terms of the total travel time. By considering real swarm robot parameters, the CBDN algorithm has resulted in an average total travel time of 17.44% less than the average total travel time of SFT and 17.25% less than the average total travel time of IRN. © 2022 IEEE.},

A novel distributed guidance algorithm is proposed based on Inhomogeneous Markov Chains, Probabilistic Density Guidance and Voronoi partition (IMC-PDG-Voronoi) algorithms. The physical space is partitioned into multiple bins and the density distribution of the swarm is controlled via a probabilistic approach. Then the modified Voronoi partition method is used to generate a collision-free trajectory for each agent. To apply the probabilistic control algorithm to circular Earth orbit, the periodic solution of the Clohessy-Wiltshire (C-W) equation in configuration space is transformed into a parameter space. Then a convex optimization open-loop controller with minimum fuel consumption in LVLH coordinates is designed to control the swarm to expected positions. Numerical simulations show that the algorithm can effectively guide and control large-scale spacecraft swarms to form complex configurations on circular orbits, with high precision and little cost.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Nowadays, the train control system with communication as the core is the first choice of the train control system of urban rail transit at home and abroad. ATO system can be used to track the target speed curve and complete automatic driving, which has achieved excellent performance in safety performance and energy saving efficiency. Although researchers have conducted in-depth studies on train operation control and train operation plan optimization, they have not comprehensively considered the relationship between the two. Therefore, on the basis of understanding the particle swarm optimization algorithm, this paper proposes a two-stage double-deck train energy saving optimization method under the undulating ramps and time constraints through optimization and improvement, so as to continuously optimize the running time of the schedule after defining the optimal energy saving target speed curve.

	abstract = {Using images from UAV oblique ultra-long focal small view field whiskbroom camera (ULF-SVF-WC) system for object positioning and mapping is more difficult than conventional aerial photogrammetry, for the particularity of oblique ULF-SVF-WC imaging mode. Therefore, the precision and accuracy of its object positioning are also quite different from that of the conventional UAV photography. In this paper, we analysed the accuracy of real-time object positioning without ground control points (GCPs) for images from UAV oblique ULF-SVF-WC System. Firstly, we studied the imaging principles and characteristics of the oblique ULF-SVF-WC system. Then, we established the coordinate transformation relationship from the object point to the image point and constructed a strict imaging model for oblique ULF-SVF-WC image, which was used for real-time single-ray back-projection positioning assisted by DEM. Thirdly, we quantitatively analysed the distribution and variation of the oblique ULF-SVF-WC image single-ray back-projection errors in theory based on error propagation law and simulation data. Finally, we conducted the experiment of real oblique ULF-SVF-WC flight images for the actual positioning accuracy analysis. The experiment results showed that: the influence of system error on positioning generally conforms to the distribution and variation of theoretical precision, that is, the accuracy of scanning direction is much lower than that of the flight direction; while the accuracy of actual single-ray back-projection positioning is evidently lower than that of the theoretical analysis and there are obvious system errors in the positioning residuals. It indicates that the 6 external orientation elements calculated from POS data contains obvious system error whose influence is greater than random error and this should be eliminated in real-time single-ray back-projection for object positioning.  © 2022 Q.

	abstract = {The problem of the lifetime of connected objects, in most use cases (Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), disaster management, etc.) is an essential element of the proposed solutions. Radio frequency (RF) harvesting of sensor batteries is an attractive solution, however, it does not scale up if it has to be done by human operators, and becomes impossible if the objects are located in unreachable places. An innovative solution consists of using fleets of drones to take care of this regular recharge. In this paper, we focus on the self-organised deployment of a fleet of drones to solve this problem, taking into account the multiple constraints involved. We propose a two-step optimization framework based on an optimal orchestration solution to reduce the recharging time of a complete sensor system, by optimizing the number of drones, the overall flight time and their energy consumption. We illustrate the performance of our framework that ensures the drones avoid conflicts to guarantee a higher energy harvesting efficiency (establishment of optimal drone positions and planning of the global flight plan). © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The work described below investigates the prospect of utilizing a two-stroke internal combustion engine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack for hybrid power generation for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAV technology is increasingly useful for large land and water management settings, such as agriculture. However, in their current state, small UAVs are limited by the lithium polymer batteries that commonly power them, which only provide power for short duration flights around 30 minutes. The proposed hybrid powertrain is capable of harnessing energy dense liquid hydrocarbon fuel, hence significantly increasing the flight endurance of UAVs. The 0.3 in3 piston engine is a typical air-cooled, glow plug ignited, two-stroke engine which acts as a partial oxidation fuel reformer, and a generator of mechanical shaft power. Additionally, a tubular SOFC stack can harness the syngas generated by the piston engine and produce electrical energy. From combustion simulation results, it was determined that a 60/40 percent (by volume) mixture of methanol and nitromethane, respectively, produced the largest quantity of total syngas. While fueling the SOFC with exhaust modeled after this fuel the SOFC generated a peak power density of ~650 mW/cm2. The hybrid power system includes the added benefit in that it can be operated in an “engine out” scenario, where the SOFC stack is fed direct liquid fuel. Operating on liquid 60/40 methanol/nitromethane fuel, a tubular SOFC produced ~580 mW/cm2 maximum power density. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {To tackle the difficulty and high cost of UAV positioning in a 5G disaster environment, this study proposes a multi-UAV coordinated positioning algorithm based on a factor graph (MUAV-FGC). A factor graph model is designed for coordinated positioning of the master-slave UAVs. In the positioning process, the influence of the speed and heading errors of the UAV on the positioning accuracy was analyzed, and the expected and variance values of the variables were used as the information transmitted between the factors. The error of the cooperative positioning algorithm was derived based on the factor graph. The coordinated positioning of multiple drones and the positioning accuracy improved. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, the proposed MUAV-FGC positioning algorithm reduces the mean positioning and root mean square error by approximately 18.86% and 17.54%, respectively, thus proving its effectiveness.  © 2022 YueXia Zhang and Pengfei Jia.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones presently are enhanced with miniature sensors that can provide information relative to their environment. As such, they can detect changes in temperature, orientation, altitude, geographical location, electromagnetic fluctuations, lighting conditions, and more. Combining this information properly can help produce advanced environmental awareness; thus, the drone can navigate its environment autonomously. Wireless communications can also aid in the creation of drone swarms that, combined with the proper algorithm, can be coordinated towards area coverage for various missions, such as search and rescue. Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the field that studies how drones, independently or in swarms, can cover an area of interest efficiently. In the current work, a CPP algorithm is proposed for a swarm of drones to detect points of interest and collect information from them. The algorithm’s effectiveness is evaluated under simulation results. A set of characteristics is defined to describe the coverage radius of each drone, the speed of the swarm, and the coverage path followed by it. The results show that, for larger swarm sizes, the missions require less time while more points of interest can be detected within the area. Two coverage paths are examined here—parallel lines and spiral coverage. The results depict that the parallel lines coverage is more time-efficient since the spiral increases the required time by an average of 5% in all cases for the same number of detected points of interest. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart agriculture benefits from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and in-field sensors to collect data used to make responsible crop management decisions which sustainably increase yields. In addition, smart agriculture relies on machine learning algorithms, creative networking solutions, and edge and cloud computing resources to collect, transfer, and process agricultural data. UAV can carry a wide array of sensors, maneuver rapidly throughout the field, apply treatments for some crop health problems, and can be flown by software. UAV, however, have small batteries and limited carrying capacities which keep missions short. In this paper, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art UAV swarm technology for smart agriculture, and present experiences from real-world agricultural UAV swarm case studies. We describe how quick mapping of large areas such as crop fields necessitates multiple UAV missions, potentially using multiple UAV simultaneously as a swarm. We detail how swarms of UAV have added advantages over a single UAV deployment. They can coordinate to map areas in parallel, leverage multiple sensor types, target areas for close inspection, and diagnose and treat problems rapidly. UAV swarms come with additional implementation difficulties beyond single UAV. We list challenges to implementers in terms of Resource allocation, compute orchestration, multi-agent mission planning and swarm goal definition. We also describe recent advances in edge computing, machine learning, and autonomy in orchestration and resource management techniques for swarm deployments. Finally, we conclude with research opportunities that future work can address to improve swarm performance, scale, and adoption for smart agriculture.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Whether it is the coordinated operation and precision strike of multiple missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ships in the military background, or the real-time and reliable communication of multiple wireless mobile terminals in the civil scene, the reconfigurability and high robustness of the network are required. In military tasks, the attack range of a single weapon is often very limited. Therefore, in order to achieve efficient combat precision attack, each node needs to achieve accurate and effective attack on the same target through grouping and clustering collaborative strategy, that is, collaborative engagement. This can not only improve the accuracy of weapon combat platforms, but also improve the network survivability of missile borne aircraft, ships, UAVs and other combat equipment nodes. In view of this background, this paper aims to propose a cluster UAV self-organizing network with superframe slot allocation algorithm by combining optimized link state routing (OLSR), time division multiple access (TDMA) and channel loss matrix. Through NS-3 simulation tool, the network performance indicators such as throughput, delay, packet loss and routing convergence of the network Model under different routing parameter configurations are statistically analyzed. The results show that the network Model has certain adaptability, and has complementary advantages and good stability with OLSR routing protocol, which also lays a foundation for subsequent engineering applications. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have been progressively prevalent due to their capability to operate quickly and their vast range of applications in a variety of real-world circumstances. The utilization of UAVs in precision farming has lately gained a lot of attention from the scientific community. This study addresses with the assistance of drones in the precision agricultural area. This paper makes significant contributions by analyzing communication protocols and applying them to the challenge of commanding a fleet of drones to protect crops from parasite infestations. In this research, the effectiveness of nine powerful deep neural network models is measured for the detection of plant diseases using diverse methodologies. These deep neural networks are adapted to the immediate situation using transfer learning and deep extraction of features approaches. The presented study takes into account the used pretrained deep learning model for extracting features and fine-tuning. The deep feature extraction characteristics are subsequently categorized using support vector machines (SVMs) and extreme learning machines (ELMs). For measuring performance, the precision, sensitivities, specific, and F1-score are all evaluated. Deep feature extraction and SVM/ELM classification generated better outcomes than transfer learning, according to the analysis result. Furthermore, the analysis of the various methodologies tries to assess their effectiveness and costs. The different approaches, for example, confront difficulties such as investigating the region in the shortest possible time feasible, while eliminating the same region being searched by more drones, detecting parasites, and stopping their spread by applying the appropriate number of pesticides. Simulation models are a significant aid to researchers in conducting to evaluate these technologies and creating specific tactics and coordinating procedures capable of effectively supporting farms and achieving the aim. The main objective of this paper is to compare the search techniques of two distinct methods of parasitic to identify performance.  © 2022 Mohamad Reda. A. Refaai et al.},

	abstract = {Defective insulator detection is an essential part of transmission line inspections based on unmanned aerial vehicles. It can timely discover insulator defects and repair them to avoid a power transmission accident. The detection speed of defective insulators based on artificial intelligence directly affects inspection efficiency. To improve the detection speed of defective insulators based on YOLOv5s, an improved detection method with faster detection speed and acceptable precision is proposed. First, a new ResNet unit with three branches is designed based on depthwise separable convolution with kernel three and average pooling. To reduce parameters, the new ResNet unit is used to replace the original ResNet unit used in the CSP1_X module in YOLOv5s. Besides, we also introduce channel shuffle in the CSP1_X module to facilitate the flow of feature information from different channels. Second, a new residual CBL module is designed based on depthwise separable and standard convolution. The new residual CBL module is used to replace the two CBL modules used in the CSP2_X module in YOLOv5s to reduce parameters and extract more useful features. Third, we design a separate, coordinated attention module by introducing location information into channel attention. The new attention module is added to the end of the CSP2_X module to improve the ability to extract insulator location information. Besides, we also use convolution to replace the focus model to reduce computation. Compared with defective insulator detection methods, the proposed method has smaller parameters, floating-point operations per second, and higher frames per second. Although it has lower mean precision, it has a faster detection speed. Besides, the increase in detection speed is greater than the decrease in mean precision.  © 2022 Zhao Liquan et al.},

	abstract = {In this work, the travel path of a set of drones is scheduled across a graph, where the nodes need to be visited multiple times at pre-defined points in time. The nodes can either be demand nodes requesting monitoring, or supply nodes that are used as take-off/landing locations for the drones and for battery replacement to cope with the limited flying range of the drones. This is an extension of the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem and the proposed formulation can be applied in several domains such as the monitoring of traffic flows in a transportation network, the monitoring of remote locations to assist search and rescue missions, or the monitoring of critical infrastructure facilities for security and surveillance purposes. Aiming to find the optimal schedule, the problem is initially formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). However, given that the problem is highly combinatorial, the optimal solution scales only for small-size problems. Thus, a greedy algorithm is also proposed that uses a one-step look-ahead heuristic search mechanism, as well as an algorithm that is based on ant colony optimization (ACO). In a detailed evaluation, it is observed that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance for small settings, while also scaling to larger settings, with the ACO being more suitable for medium-size settings and the Greedy for larger ones. A field experiment is additionally performed to demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed system under real-world conditions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The task allocation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is important in UAV search and rescue to guarantee an effective and orderly search and rescue activity. However, few studies have investigated the influences of the UAV operating environment and performance on search and rescue task allocation. Considering the influences of low-altitude wind and terrain on UAV energy consumption and performance, UAV release position (from helicopter) selection and task allocation models are proposed in this study. Given that the detection zone of UAVs is affected by topographic factors, the principal component analysis method was used to determine the search and rescue level at each search and rescue point and the UAV hovering endurance, which was determined using clustering analysis. Considering the influence factors of UAV battery energy consumption, such as UAV performance and low-altitude wind, an UAV release position selection model was constructed and solved via the improved binary bat algorithm which exhibited enhanced calculation accuracy comparing with three other algorithms. According to the release position planning result, a multi-objective (minimization of the total search and rescue cost and number of UAVs and multi-UAV task balance) optimization model was established and solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. Finally, the experimental results indicated that the solution through multiple objectives had no cost advantage comparing with those under the single objective, but exhibited an evident advantage in task completion time through sensitivity analysis of UAVs task allocation problem. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In order to solve the problem that the tomato branch and leaf pruning manipulator could not accurately find the pruning points of the tomato branch and leaf pruning manipulator, and to ensure the efficiency of the tomato branch and leaf pruning manipulator, a tomato branch feature point recognition method based on different edge types was proposed. Based on the neural network optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-BP), in this paper, an "eye on hand" visual servo control system was designed. By dividing the horizontal and vertical edges of tomato plants, the horizontal and vertical edges were extracted, and the short edges of tomato leaves were removed by threshold segmentation. The horizontal and vertical coordinates of the intersection points were recorded. The intersection points were restricted to the upper edge and lower edge of the lateral edges to obtain the dual branch points of the tomato. The test results showed that the designed visual servo system could successfully identify the tomato side branch points. The simulation test showed that the error between the actual value and the expected value of the image feature was between 3-5 pixels, and the five-degree-of-freedom manipulator moved within 4 seconds, which provides a reference for further research on agricultural pruning robots. © 2022 Journal of Chinese Agricultural Mechanization Editorial Office},

	abstract = {Coordination of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has received significant attention due to its wide practical applications including search and rescue, cooperative exploration and target surveillance. Motivated by the flexibility of the UAVs and the recent advancement of graph-based cooperative control strategies, this paper aims to develop a fault-tolerant cooperation framework for networked UAVs with applications to forest fire monitoring. Firstly, a cooperative navigation strategy based on network graph theory is proposed to coordinate all the connected UAVs in a swarm in the presence of unknown disturbances. The stability of the aerial swarm system is guaranteed using the Lyapunov approach. In case of damage to the actuators of some of the UAVs during the mission, a decentralized task reassignment algorithm is then applied, which makes the UAV swarm more robust to uncertainties. Finally, a novel geometry-based collision avoidance approach using onboard sensory information is proposed to avoid potential collisions during the mission. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework are verified initially by simulations and then using real-world flight tests in outdoor environments. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {A Pseudo-satellite system that transmits signals similar to GNSS can provide positioning services in places where GNSS signals are not captured and have enormous potential for indoor machine system and airports. Different paths of the device have different carrier phase initial solution positioning accuracy. Existing methods rely on measuring instruments or use many coordinate points for solving ambiguity resolution (AR), which creates inconvenience for real-time ground positioning. This study aims to find a new on-the-fly (OTF) method to achieve high accuracy and convenient positioning. A new method is proposed based on a two-difference observation model for ground-based high-precision point positioning. We used an adaptive particle swarm algorithm to solve the initial solution, followed by a nonlinear least-squares method to optimize the localization solution. It is free of priori information or measuring instruments. We designed several different paths, such as circular trajectory and square trajectory, to study the positioning accuracy of the solution. Simulation experiments with different trajectories showed that geometric changes significantly impact solutions. In addition, it does not require precise time synchronization of the base stations, making the whole system much easier to deploy. We built a real-world pseudo-satellite system and used a multi-sensor crewless vehicle as a receiver. Real-world experiments showed that our approach could achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy in applications. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This paper also proposes a coordination mechanism for the controller to effectively damp out the oscillations and make the power system more stable by considering the uncertainties. The uncertainty is considered as wind speed variation and wind power penetration and different locations. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to overcome the controller parameter tuning drawbacks and controller coordination. The SG rotor speed deviation is selected as an objective function with various constraints for PSO. The transient stability analysis is carried out by considering large disturbance that is a three-phase fault. The nonlinear dynamic simulation results are obtained by integrating WF and SG replacement with the same rating WF. Evaluation and analysis are performed for various cases and different combination of without and with controllers. From the simulation results, it is noticed that oscillations in the system are minimized, and stability is enhanced at the maximum level. It also observed that the capability of SG and DFIG under three-phase fault is intensified by using PSO for optimized coordinated controller parameters. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are evaluated on the IEEE-11 bus test system.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

However, due to the limited capacity of wireless networks, in peaking seasons, tourism area crowding in local areas could result in emergency and temporary wireless network congestion. While increasing infrastructure investment (e.g., densifying base stations) is desiring for peak seasons, it can be a waste of resource for significantly shrunk tourist arrival in off seasons. In response to the temporary network congestion offloading demand, this paper proposes an on-demand coverage solution based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations. Firstly, taking the air-to-ground channel characteristic into account, we define the effective coverage radius, based on which the optimal altitude of UAV BS is derived. Then, to tackle the inherent challenge of irregular tourist distribution issue in tourism areas, an automatic UAV BS deployment algorithm is designed to determine the minimal number of UAV BSs and their two-dimensional coordinates simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed solution could realize efficient UAV BS on-demand deployment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Within the context of sustainable development and a low-carbon economy, electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded as a promising alternative to engine vehicles. Since the increase of charging EVs brings new challenges to charging stations and distribution utility in terms of economy and reliability, EV charging should be coordinated to form a friendly and proper load. This paper proposes a novel approach for pricing of charging service fees in a public charging station based on prospect theory. This behavioral economics-based pricing mechanism will guide EV users to coordinated charging spontaneously. By introducing prospect theory, a model that reflects the EV owner’s response to price is established first, considering the price factor and the state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries. Meanwhile, the quantitative relationship between the utility value and the charging price or SOC is analyzed in detail. The EV owner’s response mechanism is used in modeling the charging load after pricing optimization. Accordingly, by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm, pricing optimization is performed to achieve multiple objectives such as minimizing the peak-to-valley ratio and electricity costs of the charging station. Through case studies, the determined time-of-use charging prices by pricing optimization is validated to be effective in coordinating EV users’ behavior, and benefiting both the station operator and power systems. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the common causes of a heart attack is fibrillation, a condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate. There is scientific evidence that the survival rate of sudden cardiac arrest patients who are rescued with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and with the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) is significantly increased. Despite the recommendation that automated external defibrillators should be installed in the workplace, along with a proper management system and training for employees on how to use the device, less than 70% of non-residential areas have an AED installed. The situation is even worse in residential areas, with less than 30% having an AED installed. This research concerns the development of a medical drone managing system that can deliver an AED in case of emergency. An application was developed that can be installed on the mobile phone and/or tablet of the patient or the accompanying person. In the event of a heart attack, the patient or the accompanying person can call a medical drone by sending coordinates to the drone station and a notification to medical staff. The drone station administrator can respond by sending the drone, which automatically lands at the patient’s location. After being tested in a simulation situation, the operational field test yielded satisfactory results. The medical drone can land within 1.5 meters of the destination. The designed AED drone can be used not only to deliver AEDs, but also first aid kits and prescribed drugs suitable for medical care. Such a system is especially useful in the current context of the COVID‐19 pandemic. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Search and Rescue Operations (SRO) are notoriously difficult as they typically involve human operations in high risk and low visibility environments. Often, stakeholders only have a general perception of the possible adversities in the situational environment. Ultimately, the success of these operations is a function of the manpower available, the terrain of the region, informed-decision-making based on terrain mapping and objective success in completion of search and rescue tasks with lower human casualties. A practical solution to this problem is to leverage the use of autonomous systems such as drones and rescue robots that can scout the terrain to gather information to augment the rescue team's capabilities and mission success rates. In situations, such as a combat search and rescue mission, the mission might call for a cooperative effort between a Human and AI Agent, whereby both are able to share intelligence and coordinate in decision-making tasks. In this work, we present several novel contributions through a combat search and rescue simulation scenario that leverages a drone-based AI autonomous system for detection of targets-of-interest in the environment as a basis for human-AI teaming study. In this research, we examine various human factor metrics for different modes of interactions between the human agent and AI-driven drone/autonomous system agent to include implications on human mission completion with and without drone-based AI target detection-derived human situational awareness and time to mission completion. In addition, we introduce innovative AI techniques to model human agent (player)-AI agent (drone) exchanges through a hostage rescue scenario-based simulation and explore incentive strategies directed towards the human agent to encourage adoption of AI-based autonomous system as a cooperative intelligence asset and improve human-AI teaming performance. The unification of both AI techniques to model Human-AI interaction and incentive mechanisms to encourage usage of autonomous systems sets the foundation for assessing the efficacy of AI in Human Agent Teams.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Current developments in agricultural aviation technology have gradually increased the requirements for the endurance of agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is significant to establish an endurance evaluation model for different types of UAVs and rationalize the battery and operating load parameters on this basis, which play an important role in improving the operational efficiency of the whole UAV. Taking the quad-rotor UAV as the research object, firstly, the structural composition of the whole UAV is studied in this paper, and then the main influencing parameters of the UAV endurance evaluation model are determined, combined with the mass distribution data of specific models. Based on the above, the hovering output power of the UAV is modularly divided, and a fast measurement method is innovatively proposed to sample and fit the power data of each module. Finally, in combination with the variation law of the lithium battery discharge time, a rapid evaluation method of the endurance time of agricultural UAVs is derived and validated by the hovering test data of the agri-drone with a standard operating load of 5 kg. The results show that the mass distribution system of the UAV has the highest percentage of operational load mass (40.45% under the standard configuration); the power distribution system has the highest percentage of motor pull curve output power (91.12% under the standard configuration); the maximum error of the surface verification point in the validation experiment is 2.73%, and the model is of relatively high accuracy. The modeling idea and the supporting module power rapid measurement method can quickly model and evaluate the endurance of common agricultural drones, guide reasonable matching between the battery and operating load, and are of great significance in improving UAVs’ endurance and operational efficiency. © 2022 by the authors.},

After that, the features are extracted based on user requests along with the cloud server, and the extracted features are lessened using modified principal component analysis. For RA, the split data of the user request is identified and that data is pre-processed by computing closed frequent itemset along with entropy values. After that, the user requests are scheduled using the normalized K-means algorithm (NKMA) centered on the entropy values. Finally, the apt resources are allotted to that scheduled task using the Cauchy mutation-genetic algorithm (CM-GA). The investigational outcomes exhibit that the proposed study outruns other existing algorithms in respect to response time, execution time, clustering accuracy, precision and recall. Findings: The proposed NKMA and CM-GA technique’s performance is analyzed by comparing them with the existing techniques. The NKMA performance is analyzed with KMA and Fuzzy C-means regarding Prc (Precision), Rca (Recall), F ms (f measure), Acr (Accuracy)and Ct (Clustering Time). The performance is compared to about 500 numbers of tasks. For all tasks, the NKMA provides the highest values for Prc, Rca, Fms and Acr, takes the lowest time (Ct) for clustering the data. Then, the CM-GA optimization for optimally allocating the resource in the cloud is contrasted with the GA and particle swarm optimization with respect to Rt (Response Time), Pt (Process Time), Awt (Average Waiting Time), Atat (Average Turnaround Time), Lcy (Latency) and Tp (Throughput). For all number of tasks, the proposed CM-GA gives the lowest values for Rt, Pt, Awt, Atat and Lcy and also provides the highest values for Tp. So, from the results, it is known that the proposed technique for seasonal requests RA works well and the method optimally allocates the resources in the cloud. Originality/value: The proposed approach provides energy-efficient task scheduling and RA and it paves the way for the development of effective CDC. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Such solutions are typically used in the case of disasters, lack of energy, etc. There exist several narrowband solutions that provide countrywide coverage in certain countries. In recent years, the activities related to creating mission-critical broadband solutions based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) have led to the definition of LTE Mission Critical (LTE-MC). Both solutions ignore virtualization and require dedicated mobile terminals as a part of the mission-critical communication solution. This paper describes the opportunities, open issues and a proposal of a solution that exploits Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and network virtualization for mission-critical services.

	abstract = {Robot swarms have the potential to revolutionize areas ranging from warehouse management and agriculture to underwater and space exploration. However, there remains a substantial gap between theory and robot implementation. While algorithms might assume reliable communication, perfect sensing, and instantaneous cognition, most robots have lossy or even no communication, imperfect sensing, and limited cognition speed. In our previous work on implicit vision-based coordination, we demonstrated autonomous three-dimensional behaviors underwater by removing the need for radio communication between robots. Here we explore impressionist algorithms, capable of working with even more minimal information where traditional algorithms are prone to fail. Our case study focuses on classic flocking behaviors, where a robot swarm must coordinate group motion. We demonstrate that reliable alignment, dispersion, and milling can be achieved with only infrequent and imperfect sensory impressions. In simulation studies and theoretical analyses, we investigate the effect of systematically reducing spatial and temporal fidelity of individual information on the success metrics for the group; we also demonstrate physical experiments with Blueswarm robots using simple color detection. Our results show the potential of impressionist algorithms that operate on simpler neighborhood-awareness metrics and still achieve desired global goals. © 2022 IEEE.},

The system consists of wind farm and combinations of stabilizer, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)-link and Flexible AC Transmission system (FACTS) devices. These are located at best possible point for maximum damping. Each controller is located separately based on corresponding parameter. The stabilizer is located based on optimum location index, HVDC-link w.r.t. line flows and FACTS devices from power flow sensitivity analysis. The controller parameters are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The real part of eigenvalue is the objective function for PSO and is formulated based on small signal and transient analysis. The transient stability is analysed by time domain simulation for a three-phase fault. The small signal stability analysis based on eigenvalue using state space model is carried out. Exhaustive simulation results are demonstrated for each controller and combinations of two or more controllers. It reveals that 4 controllers (stabilizer, HVDC-link, 2-FACTS devices) together has best performance. The sensitivity analysis is conducted with controller gain as sensitivity parameters. This recognizes the modes that have detrimental and beneficial effects on the system.

	abstract = {Functional topology shaping is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) swarm applications, such as remote sensing, precision agriculture, and emergency wireless communication. However, the current research on topology shaping is mostly based on the assumption that the target positions of the nodes are known or have been pre-defined. Moreover, the computational complexity of existing shaping methods is still high. In this paper, a topology shaping method based on a relative coordinate system is proposed to solve the problem of UAV swarm topology shaping with no external source of localization information. Based on the relative coordinates of nodes and target topology shape of the swarm, the topology shaping is transformed into a problem of optimal coordinate mapping from initial relative coordinates to target relative coordinates of nodes with minimized global energy consumption. The Jonker–Volgenant algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. As verified by simulations, the proposed method can achieve UAV swarm topology shaping with no external localization information. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed method has an average reduction in computation time of 94% in the case of 1000 nodes compared with existing methods with the same level of global energy consumption. © 2022 by the authors.

However, it is now common practice to implement farm level control actions during the daily operations in order to improve the economic profit of an entire wind plant. This study is then proposed to investigate the wind farm layout optimization to achieve the minimum cost per unit of energy (CoE), when the farm level control operations, the coordination of turbine cooperations (CTC), is considered preliminary farm planning stage. It is found that, by optimizing the turbine number and layout with CTC involved, the efficiency of a wind farm can be further improved. A single-objective optimization problem is firstly established by modelling all aforementioned factors of interest. Subsequently, a hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed, with a greedy algorithm to optimize the turbine number and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to refine the turbine layout scheme.

	abstract = {In a large-scale wind farm, under the influence of the wake effect, the single-machine maximum power extraction control strategy would not be able to function at the ideal optimal value. It is important to study the coordinated operation strategy of the wind farm under the wake effect to improve the output power of wind farms and improve the economic benefit. In this paper, a practical wake model called the PARK model is used and a wake superposition model based on energy balance is derived. Based on these models, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the output power of the wind farm considering the wake effect. Taking the Horns Rev offshore wind farm as an example, the stochastic points method, particle swarm optimization, and the pattern search algorithm are implemented and compared with the single-machine maximum power extraction algorithm. Test results show that the particle swarm optimization and the pattern search algorithm have better performance. The output power of the wind farm increases by about 10 percent. The particle swarm optimization requires less computation while the pattern search algorithm obtains better and more practical results. Finally, the pattern search algorithm is used to improve economic benefits under different wind conditions. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly growing due to their abilities to perform some difficult or dangerous tasks as well as many public services including real-time monitoring, wireless coverage, search and rescue, wildlife surveys, and precision agriculture. However, the electrochemical power supply system of UAV is a critical issue in terms of its energy/power densities and lifetime for service endurance. In this paper, the current power supply systems used in UAVs are comprehensively reviewed and analyzed on the existing power configurations and the energy management systems. It is identified that a single type of electrochemical power source is not enough to support a UAV to achieve a long-haul flight; hence, a hybrid power system architecture is necessary. To make use of the advantages of each type of power source to increase the endurance and achieve good performance of the UAVs, the hybrid systems containing two or three types of power sources (fuel cell, battery, solar cell, and supercapacitor,) have to be developed. In this regard, the selection of an appropriate hybrid power structure with the optimized energy management system is critical for the efficient operation of a UAV. It is found that the data-driven models with artificial intelligence (AI) are promising in intelligent energy management.

	abstract = {Fuel cells today have a variety of applications, such as fueling vehicles, which lead to a reduction in conventional fuel consumption and environmental pollution. On the other hand, in the present era, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is known as one of the most important unmanned systems for delivering postal packages, environmental monitoring, disaster relief, and military target. However, the performance of fuel cells is affected by their operating pressure and temperature. In addition, due to some political and technical considerations, the performance of these systems (especially UAV based on fuel cells) is very rare in the literature. The present work provides a conceptual design of UAV propulsion system based on a fuel cell system and a battery. The performance of two different fuel cells, namely the alkaline fuel cell (AFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), is examined separately and compared. Mission and constraint analyses of the system, as well as weight distribution of UAV, are provided. Furthermore, the performance of the UAV propulsion system in different flight modes and the performance of fuel cells under atmospheric conditions are discussed. It should be noted that reference UAV data are used for input parameters. It was found that the total power required by the UAV to carry out the mission is equal to 1253.7 W, which the share of takeoff, climb, cruise, and maximum speed flight modes were 321.3, 608.5, 118.3, and 205.6 W, respectively. Furthermore, the UAV under study, in this paper, has flight endurance of about 7.4 hours. Also, the required area of the PEMFC and AFC to supply the UAV power under the study conditions is about 0.03 and 0.6 m2, respectively. Finally, it observed that with increasing altitude (in the absence of a heating system) the performance of both fuel cells is greatly reduced. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {In Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm applications there is a need for autonomous mapping and route planning. These applications include collaborative crop monitoring, aerial transportation, offshore delivery, facility monitoring, disaster relieve as well as search and rescue. Current UAV operations are heavily dependent on human operators that require each UAV to be controlled by a dedicated safety pilot as well as a separate payload operator which limits the efficient use of UAVs required in swarm applications. There is thus an imperative to mature mapping and path planning technologies to allow UAV swarm operations. This paper explores mapping and path planning strategies that allow higher levels of autonomy for a UAV swarm to operate reliably. In this work we developed novel strategies to facilitate swarm mapping, and swarm path planning. The methods developed can be easily scaled to adapt to different UAV swarm sizes. The developed strategies are implemented and tested using simulations. Results and conclusions drawn from these simulation experiments are presented.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {【Objective】 In order to meet the field operation requirements, the UAV needs not only a rotor with the function of flexible take-off and landing, but also fixed wings with the characteristics of long endurance. A new agricultural plant protection UAV with X-shaped rotor and fixed wing hybrid structure as well as tilting function was designed. 【Method】 According to the load dynamic requirements of farmland spraying operation, the airfoil and parameters of the lifting device of UAV were designed. The body structure of the plant protection UAV was built using SolidWorks software. The aerodynamic simulation analysis of the increasing lift and speed parameters of the plant protection UAV was carried out using the Fluent software and Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. 【Result】 The simulation results showed that the lift coefficient was positively correlated with the attack angle and the airspeed, and the influence of the attack angle was stronger when it changed from 4° to 6°. The lift coefficient reached 0.81 when the attack angle corresponded to the 5°−30° tilt angle. At the airspeed of 5 m/s, the relationship between the attack angle and the tilt angle almost showed linear distribution. Forward tilt of the nose could increase the lift coefficient, and then increase the payload, so that the overall operational efficiency of plant protection UAV was improved. 【Conclusion】 The study provides a basis for the design of plant protection UAV with tilt wing, and also offers a new idea for improving the endurance time and operation efficiency of plant protection UAV. © 2022 Editorial Department, Journal of South Agricultural University.

	abstract = {In this paper, a nuclear accident emergency response system based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and bus collaboration is designed for radiation field estimation and evacuation. When a nuclear accident occurs, the radiation field is estimated firstly using the measurements acquired by UAVs. Based on the Cramer–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), the coordinate optimization combined with UAV routing is formulated as a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to maximize the estimation accuracy. Further, a two-stage solution procedure based on genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the above problem. Then, taking the predicted radiation field as input, personnel in the emergency planning zone (EPZ) are evacuated to shelters by buses. The evacuation routing problem for minimizing both the total radiation exposure and evacuation time is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solvable with efficient commercial solvers, such as Gurobi and CPLEX.

In this work, the application of Coloured Petri Nets is proposed to carry out the formal validation of the coordination model for swarms of robots IACA-DI, which was developed through bio-inspired techniques to perform tasks such as surveillance, coverage, foraging and search-and-rescue. According to the outcomes of the simulations, it was possible to formally demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the model, which proved to be robust and capable of maintaining the fundamental characteristics of swarm robotics. Besides, the main conclusions made in our previous works, through empirical observations, could be confirmed.

	abstract = {Interest in electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has grown rapidly in recent years, and their applications have expanded and diversified considerably since they first appeared, for both commercial and private purposes. Thanks to their ability to perform challenging and hazardous tasks with high mobility, safety, and low cost. As academic researchers, we are concerned with commercial multi-rotor UAVs, which are revolutionizing many public services, including search and rescue operations, wireless coverage, delivery services, precision agriculture, wildlife surveys, and real-time surveillance. One of the UAVs main issues when it comes to mobility is the limited energy autonomy/endurance. Many types of power supplies can be implemented in UAVs, each with its specific strengths and shortfalls in terms of size, charging/discharging time, energy density and power density. This paper focuses on UAVs energy aspect, with a comprehensive review of the main power sources available for multi-rotors UAVs, and energy management systems to uncover gaps and provide further insights and guidelines for future research. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

By using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) efficiently, a lot of costs of power line patrol can be saved, and the post-disaster power grid repair and power supply recovery can be sped up. Firstly, according to the characteristics of complex distribution network, a multi-UAV line patrol path optimization model was established. And then, the sum of the patrol path and the variance of multi-UAVs' patrol path were taken as the objective function. Based on the Fleury algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the Fleury-and-PSO-based UAV patrol algorithm was proposed to solve the optimization problem. Through the simulation of an example distribution network, and the comparison with the genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithm, the efficiency of multiple-UAV line patrol in distribution network was proved, the post-disaster information was obtained in the shortest time under the condition of limited endurance capacity of UAVs. In conclusion, the method proposed in this paper can rapidly provide post-disaster data support for post-disaster repair of the distribution network.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Satisfying the clients' uncompromising priorities is a challenge for decision makers of organizations that face multiple projects. This paper considers an organization with a multi-skilled workforce working on several predetermined projects under time-of-use energy tariffs where distributed load energy usage is the primary concern of energy suppliers. This paper also considers different time-of-use energy tariffs, which are among the most common strategies to reach a more balanced energy utilization. The problem is stated as a bi-objective mixed-integer programming model containing two conflicting objectives; to minimize the total cost of the multi-skilled workforce and obtain a sustainable schedule with minimum deviation from the projects' priorities. The problem is formulated mathematically, and the GAMS solver is applied for justifying the conflict between the objectives and validating the proposed formulation. In order to tackle real-life instances of the problem, intelligent algorithms based on cuckoo search, particle swarm, and genetic algorithms are developed. In the proposed algorithms, the application of a well-designed encoding and decoding structure efficiently ensures the generated solutions' feasibility. The Taguchi method is used for calibrating the parameters of the proposed meta-heuristics. Performance of the solving methods is evaluated based on some experiments, where ELECTRE method is utilized as a decision-making technique to prioritize the developed algorithms. To this aim, some well-known multi-objective measures are applied for comparative analysis of the results, where the supremacy of FSCS in terms of all metrics is declared. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

To enhance the precision and the stability of parameter identification of SOFC, EMCO discards strong random search operations of cyclone foraging operator of MRFO, and dynamically coordinates decomposition operator of AEO with revised somersault foraging operator of MRFO, which can properly balance the local exploitation and the global exploration in the optimization process. Four case studies are carried out to investigate the performance of EMCO for parameter identification of SOFC is investigated through the studies in four cases, including two test data sets of single SOFCs developed by Energy Research Centre of Netherlands and CEREL of Poland respectively, as well as two experimental data sets of a 5 kW SOFC stack at Montana State University under two different operating conditions. Besides, the impacts for the precision of the parameter identification have also been studied under variable temperatures and pressures of SOFC stack. The simulation results indicate that, compared with ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, equilibrium optimizer (EO), grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, heap-based optimizer (HBO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, AEO algorithm and MRFO algorithm, EMCO has the superiority of rapid, accuracy and stability for SOFC parameter identification. © 2022, Power System Technology Press.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are one of the effective means to provide emergency communication services in post-disaster areas. In this article, we consider data dissemination in post-disaster areas, where all Internet of Things (IoT) nodes may not have data needs all the time. The energy consumption in data dissemination is one of the key metrics to pay attention to since the charging facilities for UAVs may be limited due to the destruction of existing infrastructure. In addition, UAVs have limited endurance or lifetime, so unnecessarily flying over IoT nodes that may not have data is time consuming. Therefore, given the energy budget and data requirements of the IoT nodes, we formulated a data dissemination problem using multiple UAVs in a post-disaster area while optimizing their trajectory, mission completion time, and energy consumption. After time discretization, the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem and thus difficult to solve in general. For this reason, we jointly use the bisection search technique and the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the entire problem while aiming to optimize the trajectory and mission completion time of the considered UAV as well as the overall energy consumption. In each iteration of the BCD method, we solve the user association, trajectory optimization, and power optimization subproblems one after the other in an alternating fashion. To solve each subproblem, we employ the geometric programming (GP)-based optimization technique that transforms the variables and constraints. Regarding the initial trajectory of the UAV, we utilized dynamic programming techniques based on unsaturated data requirements of IoT nodes. We performed extensive simulations in many realistic environments to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed data dissemination scheme in post-disaster scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of enhancing the coverage of existing cellular networks by acting as aerial base stations (ABSs). Due to the limited on-board battery capacity and dynamic topology of UAV networks, trajectory planning and interference coordination are crucial for providing satisfactory service, especially in emergency scenarios, where it is unrealistic to control all UAVs in a centralized manner by gathering global user information. Hence, we solve the decentralized joint trajectory and transmit power control problem of multi-UAV ABS networks. Our goal is to maximize the number of satisfied users, while minimizing the overall energy consumption of UAVs. To allow each UAV to adjust its position and transmit power solely based on local- rather the global-observations, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework is conceived. In order to overcome the non-stationarity issue of MARL and to endow the UAVs with distributed decision making capability, we resort to the centralized training in conjunction with decentralized execution paradigm. By judiciously designing the reward, we propose a decentralized joint trajectory and power control (DTPC) algorithm with significantly reduced complexity. Our simulation results show that the proposed DTPC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning based methods, despite its low complexity. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) is being widely embraced with the number of connected devices growing rapidly. Moreover, IoT applications are emerging in diverse verticals such as connected cars, connected factories, and smart agriculture. For new business models, in order to meet key network performance indicators, connectivity must be flexible and agile. An integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial network (I-SAT) has recently stimulated interest in providing wireless communication due to its high maneuverability, versatile deployment, and pervasive connectivity. The resource planning, task distribution, and action management of an I-SAT can be accomplished through effective acquisition, coordination, transmission, and aggregation of diverse information. This paper considers an I-SAT network, in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with aerial stations and a terrestrial base station (BS), in a cognitive setting, in the presence of satellite-receiver communication, are deployed to support smart vehicles on the ground. By taking into account different limitations and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, the goal is to maximize the average throughput among users by jointly optimizing user association, BS/UAV transmission power, and UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem with a complicated expression that is hard to solve. To tackle this problem, an alternating iterative algorithm based on the block descent method is proposed. Precisely, the problem is subdivided into three subproblems, transmitter-vehicle association optimization, BS/UAV power allocation optimization, and UAV trajectory control. Then, in an iterative process, these subproblems are solved sequentially. The proposed solution uses a segment-by-segment technique, which breaks the complete UAV flight trajectory into smaller time segments to reduce computation time when the network service period is considerable. As a result, each time segment's optimization can be solved more quickly. Furthermore, the paper presents the results of network simulations carried out to assess the efficiency of the proposed solution. The findings show that the presented scheme outperforms different benchmark schemes in terms of the average user throughput when observing multiple different scenarios.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to prepare an engine for very long flights without maintenance. It also gives criteria to estimate time between overhaul by using the sensor data to have an estimation of the engine condition. In-flight refueling has introduced new challenges to UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) propulsion systems. It is now possible to run continuously an UAV without landing for long periods. For this task, it is necessary to carry a quantity of lubricant sufficient for at least one month (approximately 800h). For extremely long flights, diesel piston engines are better than spark ignition ones due to extremely low fuel consumption. A selection in the assembly line individuates those engines that are suitable for long endurance flight. This is possible because automotive engines are manufactured in thousands per day and many quality controls take place in the assembly process. Moreover, mass produced automotive engines pass several tests during the assembly process including a very short run. The results of these tests are useful for an initial selection. Then, a 25-hour trial with a very thin lubricant is sufficient to forecast the oil consumption up to 1,000 hours. The 25 hours run corresponds to the time necessary to stabilize the oil consumption rate. In addition, during the 25 hours run also the electronic infancy failures are detected. In modern engines, the electronic on board diagnosis, the full redundancy of vital sensors, electronic control units and batteries/generators, make it possible to fly safely without emergencies with random electronic failures of components and wiring. Another major requirement is to forecast the engine failure or an unacceptable deterioration in terms of mechanical performance. This paper introduced a method to evaluate the state of wear of the engine starting from a digital monitoring system. A wear model of the engine based on the real duty cycle is proposed. It is then possible to prolong the life of the engine and to increase the time between overhaul. It is also possible schedule the overhaul operation © 2006-2022 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Purpose: For the crews and assets of the European Union’s (EU’s) Joint Operations available today, but a vast area in the Mediterranean Sea to monitor, detection of small boats and rafts in distress can take up to several days or even fail at all. This study aims to outline how an energy-autonomous swarm of Unmanned Aerial System can help to increase the monitored sea area while minimizing human resource demand. Design/methodology/approach: A concept for an unattended swarm of solar powered, unmanned hydroplanes is proposed. A swarm operations concept, vehicle conceptual design and an initial vehicle sizing method is derived. A microscopic, multi-agent-based simulation model is developed. System characteristics and surveillance performance is investigated in this delimited environment number of vehicles scale. Parameter variations in insolation, overcast and system design are used to predict system characteristics. The results are finally used for a scale-up study on a macroscopic level. Findings: Miniaturization of subsystems is found to be essential for energy balance, whereas power consumption of subsystems is identified to define minimum vehicle size. Seasonal variations of solar insolation are observed to dominate the available energy budget. Thus, swarm density and activity adaption to solar energy supply is found to be a key element to maintain continuous aerial surveillance. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted extra-occupationally. Resources were limited to the available range of literature, computational power number and time budget. Practical implications: A proposal for a probable concept of operations, as well as vehicle preliminary design for an unmanned energy-autonomous, multi-vehicle system for maritime surveillance tasks, are presented and discussed. Indications on path planning, communication link and vehicle interaction scheme selection are given. Vehicle design drivers are identified and optimization of parameters with significant impact on the swarm system is shown. Social implications: The proposed system can help to accelerate the detection of ships in distress, increasing the effectiveness of life-saving rescue missions. Originality/value: For continuous surveillance of expanded mission theatres by small-sized vehicles of limited endurance, a novel, collaborative swarming approach applying in situ resource utilization is explored. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The future of space transportation is fast evolving, and we must transition to a sustainable form of technology. Skyhook presents itself with the most efficient and eco-friendly space technology and will be a crucial step towards space for all. A skyhook is an extended cable that orbits the Earth with the main spacecraft body at the centre and docking ports on the two ends. This paper considers a spinning skyhook that exploits momentum transfer to transfer the payload from the Earth's atmosphere to orbit. The proposed skyhook uses electrodynamic tether propulsion to maintain its orbit and provide propellant-free propulsion. The feasibility of using tether electrodynamic propulsion for the skyhook has already been investigated. However, the main hindrance to using the proposed transportation technology is that a spinning skyhook requires a very accurate and time-bounded control system for docking the payload to the lower end of the skyhook due to the short optimal docking period. To tackle this problem, the lower end of the skyhook consists of a drone connected to the lower end's main docking port via a long cable. The docking control design consists of two parts: force control design for the drone and thrust control of the rocket. Controlling both systems using a single control design will make the overall control very complex. Hence, both the control systems are treated independently, and the controls are integrated using reinforcement learning to offer the ideal docking combination. The reusable rocket will launch the payload from the Earth's surface to reach the docking port at the required position and time. Initially, the control is focused on the thrust control of the rocket so that it reaches the desired position and orientation. However, gradually the focus of the control shifts to force control of the robotic manipulator. A coordinated control architecture is constructed between these two independent control systems using reinforcement learning. When the docking of the payload is confirmed, the rocket will release the payload. Since the starting conditions for rocket re-entry will vary in each situation, the rocket re-entry system utilises an adaptive optimal thrust control system. The drone will return to the main docking section with the help of the cable. Numerical simulations have been done to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed concept. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF. All rights reserved.},

We consider a practical scenario that the direct links between the UAV and GUs always suffer from blockages, typically in complex urban scene. To mitigate this adverse effect, the IRS can be properly deployed to create a clear propagation environment. We maximize the sum-rate for the proposed system by jointly optimizing the IRS's phase-shift, transmit power and time allocation of GUs, and trajectory of the UAV. To handle the non-convexity caused by coupled variables, the original problem is decomposed into three subproblems and solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method.

	abstract = {This paper aims to describe the methodology used in the design and manufacture of a fixed-wing aircraft manufactured using additive techniques together with the implementation of technology based on solar panels. The main objective is increasing the autonomy and range of the UAV’s autonomous missions. Moreover, one of the main targets is to improve the capabilities of the aeronautical industry towards sustainable aircrafts and to acquire better mechanical properties owing to the use of additive technologies and new printing materials. Further, a lower environmental impact could be achieved through the use of renewable energies. Material extrusion (MEX) technology may be able to be used for the manufacture of stronger and lighter parts by using gyroids as the filling of the printed material. The paper proposes the use of minimal surfaces for the reinforcement of the UAV aircraft wings. This type of surface was never used because it is not possible to manufacture it using conventional techniques. The rapid growth of additive technologies led to many expectations for new design methodologies in the aeronautical industry. In this study, mechanical tests were carried out on specimens manufactured with different geometries to address the design and manufacture of a UAV as a demonstrator. In addition, to carry out the manufacture of the prototype, a 3D printer with a movable bench similar to a belt, that allows for the manufacture of parts without limitations in the Z axis, was tested. The parts manufactured with this technique can be structurally improved, and it is possible to avoid manufacturing multiple prints of small parts of the aircraft that will have to be glued later, decreasing the mechanical properties of the UAV. The conceptual design and manufacturing of a solar aircraft, SolarÍO, using additive technologies, is presented. A study of the most innovative 3D printers was carried out that allowed for the manufacture of parts with an infinite Z-axis and, in addition, a filler based on minimal surfaces (gyroids) was applied, which considerably increased the mechanical properties of the printed parts. Finally, it can be stated that in this article, the potential of the additive manufacturing as a new manufacturing process for small aircrafts and for the aeronautical sector in the future when new materials and more efficient additive manufacturing processes are already developed is demonstrated. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Using deep learning-based object detection algorithms for landslide hazards detection is very popular and effective. However, most existing algorithms are designed for landslides in a specific geographical range. This paper constructs a set of landslide detection models YOLOX-Pro, based on the improved YOLOX (You Only Look Once) target detection model to address the poor detection of complex mixed landslides. Wherein the VariFocal is used to replace the binary cross entropy in the original classification loss function to solve the uneven distribution of landslide samples and improve the detection recall; the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism is added to enhance the detection accuracy. Firstly, 1200 historical landslide optical remote sensing images in thirty-eight areas of China were extracted from Google Earth to create a mixed sample set for landslide detection. Next, the three attention mechanisms were compared to form the YOLOX-Pro model. Then, we tested the performance of YOLOX-Pro by comparing it with four models: YOLOX, YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, and Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD). The results show that the YOLOX-Pro(m) has significantly improved the detection accuracy of complex and small landslides than the other models, with an average precision (AP0.75) of 51.5%, APsmall of 36.50%, and ARsmall of 49.50%. In addition, optical remote sensing images of a 12.32 (Formula presented.) group-occurring landslides area located in Mibei village, Longchuan County, Guangdong, China, and 750 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images collected from the Internet were also used for landslide detection. The research results proved that the proposed method has strong generalization and good detection performance for many types of landslides, which provide a technical reference for the broad application of landslide detection using UAV. © 2022 by the authors.},

This task has presented a set of subtasks, such as group flight control, including group formation and maintaining its structure, as well as ensuring stable and controllable flight. It is believed that a group consists of a small number of UAVs, the total number of which does not exceed 5. A feature of group control is a virtual leader presence who is always present in the group and controls the flight. This feature ensures a clear advantage over a leader-follower group, in which action is coordinated by a leader, and in case of the leader’s absence, the group can lose control. The feedback on the measured coordinates of the control object is sufficient to ensure a stable flight of the group. The control signal introduced additional components by the principle of attraction/repulsion to maintain the group structure and avoid collisions. Break detection of the power line uses the built-in video recorder and Bayesian detector, which provides a minimum risk of erroneous decisions. The precision positioning devices built into the UAV are used to fix the coordinates of broken wires. Simulations and calculations confirmed these solutions. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

The objectives are concerns about new problems of 3D visualization of deformation data. Methods Firstly, we introduced iterative closest point method (ICP) to complete the registration between the TLS point cloud and UAV terrain model. Secondly, geometric mapping method was applied to achieve data fusion between GB-InSAR deformation map and TLS point cloud.The mapping deviation is difficult to be corrected by conventional methods, because the lack of artificial control points on the rockslide. Visual interpretation and GB-InSAR images simulation method were combined to extract the control points.The spatial coordinate transformation parameters were estimated with the least square method. The transformation model was established to correct the mismatch. Results The proposed method was verified by the simulation data and the actual monitoring data of a landslide. The result shows that the accuracy reaches the pixel level which meet the needs of emergency monitoring. Conclusions The proposed method is limited by the working conditions of emergency and the subjectivity of image interpretation. If the accuracy of control point selection was not narrowed, the final matching fusion position accuracy may reach pixel-level accuracy. © 2022 Wuhan University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Application of remote sensing to monitor the density of weed populations, the nitrogen concentration in leaves and the productivity of winter triticale includes prior ground-based observations of the crops state and their weed infestation with the installation of markers and the determination of their coordinates; multispectral aerial photography of crops from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); processing of obtained aerial photographs using the NDRE and NDVI indices and their interpretation by the color mosaic of images and ground mark¬ers with the identification of the boundaries of plant communities depending on the state of the crop and the distribution of weeds; drawing up a coordinate map of their distribution; application of nitrogen fertilizers and necessary herbicides during the growing season by precision farming methods on the basis of compiled maps.For weed recognition in triticale crops and the nitrogen content in plant leaves, the best results are obtained from aerial photographs processed using the NDRE index, where plant communities with normal chlorophyll and nitrogen content in the leaves have NDRE values 0,45-0,60; with moderate nitrogen deficiency and a re¬duced concentration of chlorophyll in the leaves - 0,35-0,45; with an increased lack of nitrogen - 0,25-0,35; with a high number of weeds - 0,075-0,25.The spectral density of energy brightness (SDEB) of the radiation reflected by leaves of the crop and weeds was measured with the PSR-1100 field spectroradiometer in the wavelength range of 320-1100 nm.It was demonstrated that its changes depending on the wavelength were similar for both triticale and weeds, with the lowest values of SDEB in all parts of the spectra for triticale, and higher values for dicotyledonous weeds, which were bright green on the NDVI image.Nitrogen fertilizers in triticale crops are used in autumn when cultivating the soil before sowing (15-20% of the total nitrogen norm), as well as in spring-summer growing season - early in the spring during the tillering stage (20-30%), in late spring at the beginning of booting (up to 50-60%) and in the first half of summer during the stages of heading and filling (5-10%).Before additional fertilizing during the growing season it is advisable to take aerial photo¬graphs of crops from UAV and apply the NDRE index when processing aerial images for the purpose of spatial assessment of the nitrogen content in plant leaves and the density of weeds in crops.If necessary, herbicides are used after the first and second aerial surveys during the stages of tillering and beginning of booting.Schematic maps of weed infestation of crops based on the results of the third aerial survey during the stages of heading and filling are used to assess the loss of grain yield caused by weeds. © 2022 Moskovskij Universitet.

	abstract = {Consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) is a decentralized task allocation algorithm that can produce feasible and conflict-free task assignment solution for multi-UAV system in the search and rescue scenarios. Further considering the new emerging tasks, this paper studies how to realize task reasssignment in the time-sensitive and dynamic environment. Effective task replanning algorithm aims to maximize the score value of task replanning solution when ensuring the timely allocation of the new task. Thus, an extension of CBBA called CBBA with local replanning (CBBA-LR) is proposed to produce reliable task replanning solution with quick response to the new task. Firstly, the capable matrix is adopted in CBBA-LR to denote the capable relationship between UAVs and tasks. Only capable UAVs for the new task are included in the task replanning. Then, the performing time list is introduced to the bid lists. For each UAV, CBBA-LR selects the assigned tasks whose performing times overlap the time window of the new task as the potential reset tasks. The setting of potential reset tasks effectively reduces the number of tasks included in the replanning process. After that, each UAV selects the nearest task to the new task from the potential reset task set as the reset task. Hence, CBBA-LR resets the most likely insert position of the new task from each UAV’s path. Finally, CBBA runs based on the reset task schedules to get the task replanning solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate the solution quality and convergence time of CBBA-LR from four perspectives: different time windows of the new task, different locations of the new task, continuous appearance of new tasks and different scales of search and rescue scenarios. The simulation results verify the feasibility and superiority of CBBA-LR compared with other replanning strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A well-planned humanitarian logistics aiming to rescue people and provide on-time lifesaving facilities in disaster-affected areas can significantly mitigate the repercussions of disasters. However, damaged bridges and blocked roads can hinder last-mile deliveries in disaster-affected areas to ground vehicles only. In this regard, the present study attempts to propose Ground Vehicle (GV) and Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) collaborative delivery system to be implemented in such areas. To this end, a eet of homogenous ground vehicles, each equipped with a certain number of UAVs, was deployed for last-mile deliveries. UAVs make the ight from GVs, deliver to the end locations, and return to the GV for battery replacement and/or start another ight. The main objective of the proposed model is to minimize the total delivery time within UAV ight endurance and payload constraints. First, K-means algorithm was used to cluster the disaster-affected region into different sectors. Then, GV-touring and UAV-routing were scheduled using the nearest neighbor heuristics to serve the ground approachable locations and UAV served locations, respectively. Finally, the levy ight-based Ant Colony Optimization-based (ACS RW) algorithm was developed to further optimize the overall travel time. Experimentation results show the potential superiority of the proposed algorithm over other available truck-drone collaborative transportation models.  © 2022 Sharif University of Technology.

	abstract = {Multirotor drones are becoming increasingly popular in a number of application fields, with a unique appeal to the scientific community and the general public. Applications include security, monitoring and surveillance, environmental mapping, and emergency scenario management: in all these areas, two of the main issues to address are the availability of appropriate software architectures to coordinate teams of drones and solutions to cope with the short-term battery life. This article proposes the novel concepts of Social Drone Sharing (SDS) and Social Charging Station (SCS), which provide the basis to address these problems. Specifically, the article focuses on teams of drones in pre- and post-event monitoring and assessment. Using multirotor drones in these situations can be difficult due to the limited flight autonomy when multiple targets need to be inspected. The idea behind the SDS concept is that citizens can volunteer to recharge a drone or replace its batteries if it lands on their property. The computation of paths to inspect multiple targets will then take into account the availability of SCSs to find solutions compatible with the required inspection and flight times. The main contribution of this article is the development of a cloud-based software architecture for SDS mission management, which includes a multi-drone path-optimization algorithm taking the SDS and SCS concepts into account. Experiments in simulation and a lab environment are discussed, paving the path to a larger trial in a real scenario. Copyright © 2022 Bisio, Morando, Recchiuto and Sgorbissa.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) is a viable solution to remotely charge several energy receivers (ERs) in areas with intermittent access to a source of energy. However, given the limited available energy in the on-board battery of the UAV, which is mainly required to suffice propulsion energy consumption, the UAV struggles to roam seamlessly for long intervals. A key challenge is thus to efficiently use the limited battery energy, and accordingly prolong the UAV's endurance, via controlling the underlying associated parameters such as cruising velocity. To further extend the battery lifetime, the UAV can also harness other sources of sustainable energy, such as sunlight, via solar energy harvesting. This paper studies a UAV-enabled WPT system, where a rotary-wing UAV transfers radio frequency (RF) wireless energy to several ERs at known locations. To offer uninterrupted seamless service, the UAV also harvests solar energy using solar panels. Considering the propulsion energy consumption of the UAV, we maximize the minimum average power received among all ERs over a finite cycle duration by jointly optimizing the UAV's time allocation between harvesting and charging, flight trajectory as well as velocity, and transmit power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we utilize the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Numerical results show that the proposed solution outperforms benchmark schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the growing dominance of inverter-based resources (IBRs), the synchronous inertia of the interconnected power systems (IPSs) is affected. The increase in IBRs results in a decrease in the system inertia. The decrease in inertia impacts the initial rate of decline of the frequency. Thus, there is a need for faster frequency response requirements to enhance the dynamic performance of the IPS. With the massive penetration of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into expanding smart cities, PHEVs can act as controllable loads which support the inertial response of the system in a rapid manner. This gives a scope to monitor a large amount of EV operational data to ensure reliable operation considering extensive penetration of EVs. This study proposes a stochastic and iterative based optimization for a two-area interconnected power system (IPS) coupled with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The HESS uses 10,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in each area and a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device to aid load frequency control (LFC). The 10,000 PHEVs would contribute to massive operational data, which needs to be considered while studying the IPS dynamic performance. Here, we investigated two discrete tie lines: HVDC links parallel to the alternating current (AC) tie line and a virtual synchronous power-based (VSP)-HVDC link parallel to the AC tie line. The controller’s optimal parameters are recorded using two meta-heuristic algorithms, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) along with simultaneous coordinated tuning of secondary controller and storage units. Results are taken both in the presence and absence of a HESS with two types of tie links. The analysis is performed with typical load changes and sensitivity analysis scenarios for an accurate record of variations in the outcomes. Thus, the proposed BBO-based LFC tracks the supply and demand variations, ensuring precision and accuracy, indicating improved IPS dynamic performance in smart cities.

	abstract = {The neuropsychological battery of scores and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) are significant to measure the cognitive and functional domain of the patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease. These scores collected from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre are pre-processed to obtain instances with the minimum of four visit times. Thus, we obtain visit-1 to visit-4 data with 5542 instances after pre-processing. The feature selection (Genetic Algorithm) is applied to visit-1 and visit-4 data and evaluated the performance by using Logistic Regression Model before and after imputation and as well as before and after imbalanced data handling technique. The metrics considered for evaluating the performance of Genetic Algorithm (GA) are Area Under Curve (AUC), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy. The improved performance of GA is obtained for the neuropsychological scores after Miss Forest Imputation and for FAQ scores after subjecting it to Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). In the second work, data of visit-1 instances is normalized by z score normalization and these are further subjected to different optimization techniques. All the optimization techniques are evaluated by using Random Forest, Bagging, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression classifier models and the performance are evaluated by using Area Under Curve (AUC) as the metric. From the results obtained, we infer the Particle Swarm Optimization shows the better performance than the other optimization techniques. Later in the third work, we proposed a framework for binary and multiclass classification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using three-dimensional Structural Magnetic Resonance Images (sMRI) and clinical scores from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The collected images are subjected to skull stripping, noise removal and tissue segmentation. The three-dimensional Gray Matter tissue, obtained as an output from tissue segmentation, comprises of many two-dimensional slices. But processing and training all the slices requires a lot of computational time. Therefore, our aim is to employ Convolutional Neural Network only on the significant slices and also to report the performance of the model. We propose a slice selection technique based on Shannon entropy to pick anatomically significant slices. Experimental results prove that the proposed slice selection classification framework achieves better performance when fused with clinical score. In the last work, we carried out our studies by collecting the images of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database and categorized MRI images into three different groups based on the size of a ventricular region of the brain and then employed second and higher order statistical methods to extract the textural features from each image. Then the retrieval performance is compared for the extracted texture features from GLCM, Laws Texture Energy Measure and a combination of these two methods. The combination of features from the above methods shows the better precision of 80% and 60 % in the retrieval of Group1 and Group3 images.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for plant protection have been playing increasingly important roles in agricultural field management. Nevertheless, constrained by pesticide loading capacity and battery endurance limit, the operation area of UAS or UAS swarm is quite limited, prohibiting them from serving large-scale applications. Previous works in the UAS or UAS swarm operation never considered vehicle scheduling, thus unable to cover multiple segmented agricultural fields distributed large-scale. Therefore, we propose a joint path planning and scheduling for vehicle-assisted multiple plant protection Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) operation. With the help of vehicle, UASs are able to spray pesticide on numerous fields distributed large-scale. Vehicle stop selection, the coordination between vehicle scheduling and UASs tasks assignment along with path planning could be determined and optimized. The test results show that the overall efficiency and the vehicle stop selection are greatly affected by the UAS number and loading capacity. Vehicle-assisted multi-UASs total operation time and non-spraying flight distance could be saved, with optimized vehicle stops utilizing a binary-coded genetic algorithm (GA). The total operation time difference could be minimal in certain cases when deploying different UAS swarms with the same UAS number but different loading capacity. A significant reduction in total operation time and UASs non-spraying flight distance could be achieved by using the proposed method. Compared with other methods, the total operation time could be reduced by 2 h when controlling 2 or 3 UASs; moreover, a sharp decrease (20–30%) in UAS swarm non-spraying flight distance wastage could be attained. © 2022},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of drone technology, logistics giants like Amazon and SF Express have applied drones to parcel delivery. Drone delivery could eliminate delivery delays caused by traffic lights and traffic jams on ground vehicles, and it can deliver parcels in case of road damage caused by natural disasters. Based on this motivation, we study a new logistics delivery problem using heterogeneous multi-drone, namely, HDDP, where a large drone carries multiple small drones to distribution regions. The new features of HDDPs are multifold. First, the large drone does not directly deliver parcels, but rather launches small drones to deliver parcels. Second, the HDDP allows each small drone to deliver multiple parcels in a flight considering energy consumption according to its payload and endurance. Third, the small drone is launched from the large drone and lands at the automatic airport. In addition, we design a three-stage-based iterative optimization algorithm to reduce the complexity of the HDDP. Specifically, at the first stage, a fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm considering the small drone's payload is designed to cluster customers; at the second stage, an improved variable neighborhood descent algorithm is developed to plan the route of the large drone; at the third stage, the dynamic programming algorithm is adopted to plan the routes of the small drones. These three stages are iteratively optimized until the termination criterion is met.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the characteristics of portability, safety, and strong adaptability. In the case of a maritime disaster, they can be used for personnel search and rescue, real-time monitoring, and disaster assessment. However, the power, computing power, and other resources of UAVs are often limited. Therefore, this paper combines a UAV and mobile edge computing (MEC), and designs a deep reinforcement learning-based online task offloading (DOTO) algorithm. The algorithm can obtain an online offloading strategy that maximizes the residual energy of the UAV by jointly optimizing the UAV’s time and communication resources. The DOTO algorithm adopts time division multiple access (TDMA) to offload and schedule the UAV computing task, integrates wireless power transfer (WPT) to supply power to the UAV, calculates the residual energy corresponding to the offloading action through the convex optimization method, and uses an adaptive (Formula presented.) method to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the DOTO algorithm proposed in this paper for the energy-saving goal of maximizing the residual energy of UAVs in MEC can provide the UAV with an online task offloading strategy that is superior to other traditional benchmark schemes. In particular, when an individual UAV exits the system due to insufficient power or failure, or a new UAV is connected to the system, it can perform timely and automatic adjustment without manual participation, and has good stability and adaptability. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Multicopters are among the most versatile mobile robots. Their applications range from inspection and mapping tasks to providing vital reconnaissance in disaster zones and to package delivery. The range, endurance, and speed a multirotor vehicle can achieve while performing its task is a decisive factor not only for vehicle design and mission planning, but also for policy makers deciding on the rules and regulations for aerial robots. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work proposes the first approach to estimate the range, endurance, and optimal flight speed for a wide variety of multicopters. This advance is made possible by combining a state-of-the-art first-principles aerodynamic multicopter model based on blade-element-momentum theory with an electric-motor model and a graybox battery model. This model predicts the cell voltage with only 1.3% relative error (43.1 mV), even if the battery is subjected to non-constant discharge rates. Our approach is validated with real-world experiments on a test bench as well as with flights at speeds up to 65 km/ h in one of the world's largest motion-capture systems. We also present an accurate pen-and-paper algorithm to estimate the range, endurance and optimal speed of multicopters to help future researchers build drones with maximal range and endurance, ensuring that future multirotor vehicles are even more versatile.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a key component of an alternating current (AC) multimicrogrid (MMG), an energy management system must gather the necessary information and coordinate the corresponding equipment to optimize the economic benefits. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a bilevel energy optimization model. The lower level model considers the real-time electricity price of distribution networks (DNs) to optimize the operation cost of each grid-connected submicrogrid (SMG). The upper level constructs an MMG optimization model based on graph theory, which optimizes the energy transmission path among the SMGs by considering the transmission losses. In this manner, the upper level model can further reduce the economic cost of an MMG by energy trading among the SMGs. To solve this model, a nested Jaya–Dijkstra algorithm is customized. Moreover, a Jaya algorithm with nonlinear variation capability (NVCJA) is developed to avoid the premature convergence problem and enhance the solution precision. The performance of the bilevel optimization strategy is evaluated considering a typical AC MMG system. For the proposed NVCJA, the convergence time is 24.07%, 39.47%, 37.76%, and 48.77% less, and the standard deviation is 12.97%, 28.71%, 23.89% and 35.92% lower than those for the Jaya, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms, respectively. The analysis results show that the proposed optimization algorithm exhibits a high operating speed and stability. The economic cost of the proposed bilevel optimization model is 19% and 29% lower than those of the hierarchical optimization and linear relaxation optimization models, respectively. The test results show that the proposed optimization model can effectively enhance the economic benefits of an MMG. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ground target three-dimensional positions measured from optical remote-sensing images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle play an important role in related military and civil applications. The weakness of this system lies in its localization accuracy being unstable and its efficiency being low when using a single unmanned aerial vehicle. In this paper, a novel multi–unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative target localization measurement method is proposed to overcome these issues. In the target localization measurement stage, three or more unmanned aerial vehicles simultaneously observe the same ground target and acquire multiple remote-sensing images. According to the principle of perspective projection, the target point, its image point, and the camera’s optic center are collinear, and nonlinear observation equations are established. These equations are then converted to linear equations using a Taylor expansion. Robust weighted least-squares estimation is used to solve the equations with the objective function of minimizing the weighted square sum of re-projection errors from target points to multiple pairs of images, which can make the best use of the effective information and avoid interference from the observation data. An automatic calculation strategy using a weight matrix is designed, and the weight matrix and target-position coordinate value are updated in each iteration until the iteration stopping condition is satisfied. Compared with the stereo-image-pair cross-target localization method, the multi–unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative target localization method can use more observation information, which results in higher rendezvous accuracy and improved performance. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of this method is verified by numerical simulation and flight testing. The results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the precision of the target’s localization and demonstrates great potential for providing more accurate target localization in engineering applications. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, applications involving multiple robotic systems connected through a wireless network - to perform tasks together - have an increased research interest. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are excellent tools for evaluating and surveying distributed robotic systems applications due to their flexibility and three-dimensional mobility capability. Cooperative systems composed of multiples UAVs may have a centralized coordination which assists the members of a team to make their decisions in a distributed manner regarding the tasks to be performed. This paper proposes a system composed of embedded hardware and a high-level communication protocol that serves as a basis for identifying, distributing, and allocating tasks in a simple and distributed way to be used by groups of UAVs. The proposal is evaluated in a search and rescue scenario. The setup is configured with two types of UAVs - namely, searchers (search for new tasks) and workers (execution of tasks). Also, a set of nine simulation experiments covering three different setups were performed. Then the proposal is evaluated by two sets of field experiments with real vehicles. The obtained results in the proposed experiments demonstrate that the system can be successfully used in the proposed scenario for task distribution and allocation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have lately been widely used due to its abundant practice in methods that have to be spread over a large range. In any wireless application, the position precision of node is an important core component. Node localization intends to calculate the geographical coordinates of unknown nodes by the assistance of known nodes. In a multidimensional space, node localization is well-thought-out as an optimization problem that can be solved by relying on any metaheuristic’s algorithms for optimal outputs. This paper presents a new localization model using Salp Swarm optimization Algorithm with Doppler Effect (LOSSADE) that exploit the strengths of both methods. The Doppler effect iteratively considers distance between the nodes to determine the position of the nodes. The location of the salp leader and the prey will get updated using the Doppler shift. The performance validation of the presented approach simulated by MATLAB in the network environment with random node deployment. A detailed experimental analysis takes place and the results are investigated under a varying number of anchor nodes, and transmission range in the given search area. The obtained simulation results are compared over the traditional algorithm along with other the state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed LOSSADE model depicts better localization performance in terms of robustness, accuracy in locating target node position and computation time. © 2021 MECS.},

	abstract = {Short-term load forecasting plays a central role in the daily operation and dispatching of power systems. Greater flexibility and uncertainty in the operation of power systems have brought harsh requirements on the accurate forecasting of short-term load, particularly with the in-depth advancement of power market reform. A high-precision prediction model is also highly demanding to effectively coordinate the relationship between power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption. In this study, short-term load forecasting was therefore proposed using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) modal combination. The VMD was adopted for the adaptive signal decomposition of load sequence, considering the time and frequency domain in the signal decomposition evaluation. The impact of two dimensions on authenticity, independence, and performance was quantitatively clarified, further to determine the evaluation indicators of signal decomposition. An authenticity test of signal decomposition included the redundant component and residual difference component. In redundant components, the Pearson correlation coefficient of the component and the original signal was compared with the authenticity threshold from the perspective of the time domain. In residual components, the ratio of frequency band with significant amplitude in the residual spectrum to the original signal frequency band was used to measure the spectral characteristics of residual components from the perspective of the frequency domain. In the independence index test, two indicators were used to evaluate in the two dimensions of time and frequency domain, including the average Pearson correlation coefficient between the signal components, and the average overlap of significant frequency bands. Time domain was measured using the average Pearson correlation coefficient of each component and the original signal. The average concentration index of the significant frequency band was also selected to verify the signal decomposition. Three indicators were integrated to establish a comprehensive evaluation indicator for signal decomposition. PSO was then used to optimize the parameters of the VMD model, where the comprehensive evaluation index of signal decomposition was taken as the objective function. The influencing factors of daily load included temperature, humidity, historical load, and day-ahead electricity price. The modal combination was used to integrate the modal sequence of influencing factors with similar periodicity in the frequency domain of load. The number of influencing factors after combination was expanded the same as the significant frequency bands of the load frequency domain, where the combined influencing factor modal presented a strong correlation with the load sequence. The expanded variables of influencing factors were input into the PSO-least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model for the load forecast of the day. The simulation results show that the VMD decomposition using the evaluation index optimization was better than the wavelet analysis, optimized ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), and non-optimized VMD, indicating the decomposed modal sequence behaved higher quality. Specifically, The maximum relative error increased by 3.36 percentage point, the average relative error increased by 1.71 percentage point, the maximum absolute error increased by 95MW, and the average absolute error increased by 55.72 MW, compared with the PSO-LSSVM using a modal combination. This finding can provide sound support to the construction of a power market with flexible power regulation under the penetration of a high proportion of renewable energy, efficient grid interconnection, and extensive user response. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems with high-resolution cameras have been found useful for operations such as smart city and disaster management. These systems feature Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) that connect the computation edge with UAVs and a Ground Control Station (GCS) through air-to-ground wireless network links. Leveraging the edge/fog computation resources effectively with energy-latency-awareness, and handling intermittent failures of FANETs are the major challenges in supporting video processing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel “DroneCOCoNet” framework for drone video analytics that coordinates intelligent processing of large video datasets using edge computation offloading and performs network protocol selection based on resource-awareness. We present two edge computation offloading approaches, i.e., heuristic-based and reinforcement learning-based approaches. These approaches provide intelligent task sharing and co-ordination for dynamic offloading decision-making among UAVs. Our scheme handles the problem of computation offloading tasks in two separate ways: (i) heuristic decision-making process, and (ii) Markov decision process; wherein we aim to minimize the total computation costs as well as latency in the edge/fog resources while minimizing video processing times to meet application requirements. Our experimental results show that our heuristic-based offloading decision-making scheme enables lower scheduling time and energy consumption for low drone-to-ground server ratios. In comparison, our dynamic reinforcement learning-based decision-making approach increases the accuracy and saves overall time periodically. Notably, these results also hold in various other multi-UAV scenarios involving largely different numbers of detected objects in e.g., smart farming, transportation traffic flow monitoring and disaster response. © 2021},

	abstract = {In disaster areas, a large amount of data (e.g., rescue commands, road damage, and rescue experience) should be delivered among ground rescuing vehicles for safe driving and efficient rescue. When communication infrastructures are destroyed by disasters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to perform immediate rescue missions in destroyed areas and assist data sharing for ground Internet of vehicles (IoV). However, in such UAV-assisted IoV under disaster situation, there exist potential security threats on data sharing among vehicles and UAVs because of the untrusted network environment, unreliable misbehavior tracing, and low-quality shared data. To address these issues, in this article, we develop a lightweight vehicular blockchain-enabled secure (LVBS) data sharing framework in UAV-aided IoV for disaster rescue. First, we propose a novel UAV and blockchain-assisted collaborative aerial-ground network architecture in disaster areas. Second, we develop a credit-based consensus algorithm in the lightweight vehicular blockchain to securely and immutably trace misbehaviors and record data transactions for UAVs and vehicles with improved efficiency and security in reaching consensus. Third, since UAVs and vehicles have little explicit knowledge of the whole network, we develop reinforcement learning-based algorithms to optimally schedule the pricing and quality of data sharing strategies for both data contributor and data consumer via trial and error. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, which demonstrate that LVBS can effectively improve the security of consensus phase and promote high-quality data sharing.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The localization of Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been recognized as one of the most challenging problems to overcome. Thus, much work has been given to solving this difficult problem. In emergency services, navigational systems, civil/military surveillance etc., locating the signal source in a WSN is essential. A novel approach for sensor node localization using range-based localization methodology has been proposed to overcome this issue. The problem is expressed in the form of a maximum probability distribution function. The use of an RSSI-based Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurement model, along with the Chan algorithm, is used to find the coordinates of unknown nodes has been proposed. With the help of ultra-wideband, this research aims to develop new and precise localization algorithms for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This work offers localization using two-hybrid localization algorithms, i.e., ELPSO (Ensemble learning particle swarm optimization) and PSO- BPNN (Back-propagation neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization). Further, the error optimization accuracy has been compared between those algorithms using simulations. The proposed techniques consistently offer a better localization accuracy than the conventional algorithms available in the literature. The new localization methods with optimal techniques reduce the error value to a minimal distance. The distance value of localization error is nearly2.7cms compared to other designs from the literature. It is noted as significantly less.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In these systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate with each other based on a flying network to provide services to customers such as live streaming, high-speed access point, etc. The mobility of UAVs can bring numerous advantages in emergency cases, for example, rescuing and searching victims in areas where the network infrastructure is not available. However, the crucial task needed to be done first is to locate the victims' coordinates. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting the coordinates of subscribers with the Wi-Fi signals generated from victims' phones in the absence of network infrastructure of communication operators using a flying network for emergencies based on UAV-swarms. We develop a new protocol for communication between UAVs and UAV-swarms. A structure of UAV-swarms is considered to optimize the searching time.

	abstract = {With an increase of UAVs in logistics and transportation, the safety of UAVs operated in the urban wind environment becomes an important issue. Small UAVs are more sensitive to the wind environment because of their small size, slow cruising speed, and limited endurance. In the unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM), a safety risk assessment under bad weather conditions is an important component. In this study, a hazardous flight region prediction system for small UAVs operated in urban areas is developed using a deep neural network (DNN) to support a risk assessment and safe trajectory planning. A large eddy simulation (LES) is applied to reflect the terrain-driven wind environment in the urban area. The result of a weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is used as an initial and boundary condition of the LES to generate a realistic complicated wind environment in an urban area. Furthermore, an iterative nesting algorithm is applied to the LES to obtain a sufficient resolution of the wind environment, which is suitable for the small UAV scale. The deviation distance from the original flight path due to the wind environment is considered as a flight hazard criterion in this study. The proposed system is able to predict deviation distance due to the wind environment over the entire flight space over time by using the DNN model. The training data for the DNN is obtained using the multicopter flight dynamics simulator, which can take into account the influence of a specific wind environment. With the indexes considering this deviation distance and the local topography (distribution of buildings) in the urban area, the hazardous flight region is predicted. The information supplied by the proposed hazardous flight region prediction model can be used for the flight risk assessment and safe flight trajectory planning to increase the flight safety of small UAVs. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Forecasts announce that the number of connected objects will exceed 20 billion by 2025. Objects, such as sensors, drones or autonomous cars participate in pervasive applications of various domains ranging from smart cities, quality of life, transportation, energy, business or entertainment. These inter-connected devices provide storage, computing and activation capabilities currently under-exploited. To this end, we defined “Spatial services”, a new generation of services seamlessly supporting users in their everyday life by providing information or specific actions. Spatial services leverage IoT, exploit devices capabilities (sensing, acting), the data they locally store at different time and geographic locations, and arise from the spontaneous interactions among those devices. Thanks to a learning-based coordination model, and without any pre-designed composition, reliable and pertinent spatial services dynamically and fully automatically arise from the self-composition of available services provided by connected devices. In this paper, we show how we extended our learning-based coordination model with semantic matching, enhancing syntactic self-composition with semantic reasoning. The implementation of our coordination model results in a learning-based semantic middleware. We validated our approach on various experiments: deployments of the middleware in various settings; instantiation of a specific scenario and various other case studies; experiments with hundreds of synthetic services; and specific experiments for setting up key learning parameters. We also show how the learning-based coordination model using semantic matching favours service composition, by exploiting three ontological constructions (is-a, isComposedOf, and equivalentTo), de facto removing the syntactic barrier preventing pertinent compositions to arise. Spatial services arise from the interactions of various objects, provide complex and highly adaptive services to users in seamless way, and are pertinent in a variety of domains such as smart cities or emergency situations. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the recent decade, the rapid development of drone technologies has made many spatial problems easier to solve, including the problem of 3D reconstruction of large objects. A review of existing solutions has shown that most of the works lack the autonomy of drones because of nonscalable mapping techniques. This paper presents a method for centralized multi-drone 3D reconstruction, which allows performing a data capturing process autonomously and requires drones equipped only with an RGB camera. The essence of the method is a multiagent approach—the control center performs the workload distribution evenly and independently for all drones, allowing simultaneous flights without a high risk of collision. The center continuously receives RGB data from drones and performs each drone localization (using visual odometry estimations) and rough online mapping of the environment (using image descriptors for estimating the distance to the building). The method relies on a set of several user-defined parameters, which allows the tuning of the method for different task-specific requirements such as the number of drones, 3D model detalization, data capturing time, and energy consumption. By numerical experiments, it is shown that method parameters can be estimated by performing a set of computations requiring characteristics of drones and the building that are simple to obtain. Method performance was evaluated by an experiment with virtual building and emulated drone sensors. Experimental evaluation showed that the precision of the chosen algorithms for online localization and mapping is enough to perform simultaneous flights and the amount of captured RGB data is enough for further reconstruction. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Autonomous and mobile cyber-physical machines are becoming an inevitable part of our future. In particular, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have seen a resurgence in activity. With multiple use cases, such as surveillance, search and rescue, package delivery, and more, these unmanned aerial systems are on the cusp of demonstrating their full potential. Despite such promises, these systems face many challenges, one of the most prominent of which is their low endurance caused by their limited onboard energy. Since the success of a mission depends on whether the drone can finish it within such duration and before it runs out of battery, improving both the time and energy associated with the mission are of high importance. Such improvements have traditionally been arrived at through the use of better algorithms. But our premise is that more powerful and efficient onboard compute can also address the problem. In this article, we investigate how the compute subsystem, in a cyber-physical mobile machine such as a Micro Aerial Vehicle, can impact mission time (time to complete a mission) and energy. Specifically, we pose the question as what is the role of computing for cyber-physical mobile robots? We show that compute and motion are tightly intertwined, and as such a close examination of cyber and physical processes and their impact on one another is necessary. We show different "impact paths"through which compute impacts mission metrics and examine them using a combination of analytical models, simulation, and micro and end-to-end benchmarking. To enable similar studies, we open sourced MAVBench, our tool-set, which consists of (1) a closed-loop real-time feedback simulator and (2) an end-to-end benchmark suite composed of state-of-the-art kernels. By combining MAVBench, analytical modeling, and an understanding of various compute impacts, we show up to 2X and 1.8X improvements for mission time and mission energy for two optimization case studies, respectively. Our investigations, as well as our optimizations, show that cyber-physical co-design, a methodology with which both the cyber and physical processes/quantities of the robot are developed with consideration of one another, similar to hardware-software co-design, is necessary for arriving at the design of the optimal robot. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The presented algorithm is analytical and allows obtaining the correct distribution result for any consistent input data. The algorithm is based on the principle of preliminary combining elementary tasks into clusters on a territorial basis. The results of simulation showed that the proposed labour distribution algorithm allows to achieve an average of 4.7% - 12.8% less time to complete a global task in comparison with the greedy algorithm.

The total laboratory activity was analyzed per min for the complete year of 2018. The time from the clinical ordering of tests to the loading of the drone, drone transport time, and analysis time after the sample arrived at the analyzing laboratory were assessed using the lead time of emergency analyses of C‐reactive protein, troponin, and the international normalized ratio. The activity had characteristic diurnal patterns, with the most intensive traffic between 8 and 12 a.m. on week-days and there being considerably less traffic for the rest of the day, at night and on weekends. Drone schedules with departures 15–60 min apart were simulated. A maximum of 15 min between flights was required to meet the emergency demand for the analyses being completed within 60 min. The required drone weight capacity was below 3.5 kg at all times. In multiple simulations, the drone times were appropriate, whereas variations in the clinic‐ and laboratory‐related time intervals caused violations of the allowed time 50% of the time. Drone transport with regular schedules may potentially improve the transport time compared with traditional ground transport and allow the merging of large laboratories, even when the demand for emergency analyses restricts the maximum transport time. Comprehensive economic evaluations and robust drone technology are needed before such solutions can be ready for implementation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Distributed work systems such as disaster response operations involve heterogeneous actors that need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. When operating in complex work domains, distributed work systems need to adapt their strategies and capabilities to meet varying and uncertain demands. Resilience engineering describes how distributed work systems respond to variable demands through managing adaptive capacity. This paper proposes a dynamic model of adaptation of a single unit of adaptive behavior in a distributed work system. The proposed model captures how managing one’s adaptive capacity involves work, effort, and resources that can compete with efforts required to respond to immediate demands. The paper discusses the model and its theoretical foundations in the context of disaster response with unmanned aerial vehicles. Results from a simple numerical simulation experiment, examining three strategies for responding to increasing demands, illustrate how the model can be used to analyze dynamics of adaptation. Potential applications of this model are in research on complex, safety-critical operations, in which simulation can be used to analyze resilient control strategies, and operational settings, in which the models could be used in conjunction with operational data to better understand how adaptive capacity is managed. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {The position calibration of inertial measurement units (IMUs) is an important part of human motion capture, especially in wearable systems. In realistic applications, static calibration is quickly invalid during the motions for IMUs loosely mounted on the body. In this paper, we propose a dynamic position calibration algorithm for IMUs mounted on the waist, upper leg, lower leg, and foot based on joint constraints. To solve the problem of IMUs’ position displacement, we introduce the Gauss–Newton (GN) method based on the Jacobian matrix, the dynamic weight particle swarm optimization (DWPSO), and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to realize IMUs’ position calibration. Furthermore, we establish the coordinate system of human lower limbs to estimate each joint angle and use the fusion algorithm in the field of quaternions to improve the attitude calibration performance of a single IMU. The performances of these three algorithms are analyzed and evaluated by gait tests on the human body and comparisons with a high-precision IMU-Mocap reference device. The simulation results show that the three algorithms can effectively calibrate the IMU’s position for human lower limbs. Additionally, when the degree of freedom (DOF) of a certain dimension is limited, the performances of the DWPSO and GWO may be better than GN, when the joint changes sufficiently, the performances of the three are close. The results confirm that the dynamic calibration algorithm based on joint constraints can effectively reduce the position offset errors of IMUs on upper or lower limbs in practical applications. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This article mainly researches the problem of distributed finite-time coordinated path-following for under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) within a network swarm. Each vehicle in swarm system suffers from velocity restrictions and multiple uncertainties including parameter perturbations and time-varying environment disturbances. Based on the constructed bionic swarm pattern and potential function, the swarm velocity guidance (SVG) with self-organization and collision avoidance is developed to guide ASV surge velocities and heading angles simultaneously. A distributed observer by adding correction terms to the vehicle model is involved to identify the lumped uncertainties, and the estimations are utilized as feed-forward compensation to weaken the uncertainty impact, thus achieving high tracking precision. By using asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function, the uncertainty observer based distributed surge and heading kinetics controllers under physical restrictions are devised to guarantee that the guided signals generated by SVG are tracked within finite time. Through simulation studies of swarm path-following, it is demonstrated that the designed control approach is feasible and efficient for multiple uncertain under-actuated ASVs. © 2020 ISA},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of completely flying over an area just hit by an earthquake with a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to opportunely direct rescue teams. The cooperation between UAVs ensures that the search for possible survivors can be faster and more effective than the solutions currently implemented by civil protection. To study this scenario, we introduce the Cover by Multitrips with Priorities (CMP) problem, which tries to keep into account all the main real-life issues connected to the flight and coordination of the UAVs. We conduct a theoretical study to estimate the best number of UAVs and additional batteries, to give indications to the organization that leads the rescue teams to be able to guarantee rapid and effective rescue. Finally, based on some theoretical considerations, we propose some heuristics that tackle the problem of flying over the whole area with a fleet of UAVs in the shortest possible time. Simulations show that they work efficiently in both the proposed scenarios and provide better performance than previous solutions once they are arranged to work in our scenarios. The main advantages of our approach w.r.t. the current drone-based solutions used by the civil defense are that UAVs do not need drivers so the time of all available rescue workers can be invested in doing something else. In our model, we take into account that some sites (e.g. buildings with a high fire risk or schools and hospitals) have a higher priority and must be inspected first, and the possibility that UAVs can make a decision based on what they detect. Finally, our approach allows UAVs to collaborate so that the same sites will be flown over exactly once in order to speed up the rescue mission.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The reasons are many, from a great variety of projects goals to the number of parameters involved: camera features, flight plan design, block control and georeferencing options, Structure from Motion settings, etc. Above all, perhaps, stands camera calibration with the alternative between pre-and on-the-job approaches. In this paper we present a Monte Carlo simulation study where the accuracy estimation of camera parameters and tie points’ ground coordinates is evaluated as a function of various project parameters. A set of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) synthetic photogrammetric blocks, built by varying terrain shape, surveyed area shape, block control (ground and aerial), strip type (longitudinal, cross and oblique), image observation and control data precision has been synthetically generated, overall considering 144 combinations in on-the-job self-calibration. Bias in ground coordinates (dome effect) due to inaccurate pre-calibration has also been investigated. Under the test scenario, the accuracy gap between different block configurations can be close to an order of magnitude. Oblique imaging is confirmed as key requisite in flat terrain, while ground control density is not. Aerial control by accurate camera station positions is overall more accurate and efficient than GCP in flat terrain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, it is challenging to provide the sustainable energy for sensors deployed in buildings, soil or other places, where it is hard to harvest the energy from environment. To address this issue, we design a new wireless charging system, which levers the bus network assisted drone in urban areas. We formulate the drone scheduling problem based on this new wireless charging system to minimize the total time cost of drone subject to all sensors can be charged under the energy constraint of drone. Then, we propose an approximation algorithm DSA for the energy tightened drone scheduling problem. To make the tasks of WRSN sustainable, we further formulate the drone scheduling problem with deadlines of sensors, and present the approximation algorithm DDSA to find the drone schedule with the maximal number of sensors charged by the drone before deadlines. Through the extensive simulations, we demonstrate that DSA can reduce the total time cost by 84.83% compared with Greedy Replenished Energy algorithm, and uses at most 5.98 times of the total time cost of optimal solution on average. Then, we also demonstrate that DDSA can increase the survival rate of sensors by 51.95% compared with Deadline Greedy Replenished Energy algorithm, and can obtain 77.54% survival rate of optimal solution on average. © 2021},

Due to the limited energy storage capacity and inefficiency of rechargeable batteries, drones must execute their missions as fast as possible with the most efficient machine learning algorithms for perception, planning, and control tasks. Motivated by the aforementioned need, agile aerial robots have gained increasing interest in the robotics community. Autonomous drone racing (ADR), which is one of the most challenging robotics problems, is an appropriate testbed for benchmarking efficiency of developed machine learning algorithms as well as their required sensors. ADR problem is chosen to demonstrate the value of the developed deep neural network-based algorithms as drones require low-latency of processing, since they have to maneuver and react to the changes in the environment rapidly throughout the race. In this chapter, we introduce deep learning methods for perception and planning of aerial robots as applied to ADR problem. We present two distinct approaches: system decomposition and end-to-end planning. In the former, we present how convolutional neural networks are used for gate localization and gate pose estimation in perception, either by predicting a gate’s center or building a 3D global gate map. In the latter, we show how to bypass the perceive-plan-act subtasks and utilize deep learning methods, such as transfer learning and reinforcement learning, to learn directly from raw images and calculate desired robot actions. Furthermore, a few useful simulation tools and data sets are introduced for ADR to develop, validate, and evaluate novel algorithms. We believe developed algorithms for ADR can be transferred to other domains in which drones must navigate in a cluttered environment without a need for external sensing. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Nowadays, there has been more attention paid to clean energies, especially wind, since there is a shortage of fossil fuel resources, but there is a decrease in pollutants that result from such sources. Such energies play a significant role in generating power. The non-linear nature of wind speed poses challenges and difficulty in exploiting its power. As a result, an accurate and efficient prediction of wind power will serve as a crucial means for solving the system's planning and operational issues. This article aims to predict a wind power plant's power output using weather and power plant parameters and employ an extended fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN). In the extended method, any fuzzy set rule uses different fuzzy wavelet functions to convert input space into a subspace. A uniform hybrid learning algorithm was used in the extended FWNN method to obtain an optimal proportion of parameters. The method was an optimal combination of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gradient Descent algorithms. The use of optimized PSO is slightly different from the basic PSO in that in this method, two layers of PSO are used within each other. Not only it has high convergence but also higher coordination and adaptability with the gradient descent algorithm. This method was used for the Manjil wind power plant in Iran, with real data being recorded every 10 min. The extended FWNN method was also compared with the conventional prediction methods. The results showed that compared to other methods reported earlier, the proposed method was a more efficient tool and had higher precision for short-term wind power forecasting. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Electric vehicles (EV) plus unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a novel post-disaster emergency rescue pattern. In an EV-UAV system, the EV acts as a mobile depot to support its mounted UAVs while the UAVs depart from the EV to complete various rescue tasks. And distributed energy sources, e. g., a microgrid and a battery-swapping station, can provide charging services for the EV to enlarge its endurance. A two-echelon framework is presented based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to perform joint optimal scheduling considering constraints such as time windows of demand points, energy endurance and load capacities of UAVs.

	abstract = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially swarming UAVs are widely deployed in a variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. Since UAVs' positions are essential for their collaboration, high-precision localization for swarming UAVs has attracted a lot of attention. Although the global positioning system (GPS) receiver has been widely integrated in UAV, it is not accurate enough and is prone to accidental or deliberate interferences. In this article, we propose a distributed and collaborative localization method for swarming UAVs that combines super multidimensional scaling (SMDS) and patch dividing/merging with GPS information. Specifically, the SMDS is first used to get the relative coordinates of the UAVs in each patch, then we merge relative map patches into a global map and transform the relative coordinates of the UAVs to their absolute coordinates. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that greatly reduces the computational complexity of SMDS with a large number of UAVs. Simulation results validate that with accurate enough angle measurements, the proposed SMDS localization algorithm outperforms the other MDS-based collaborative localization algorithms and can greatly improve the localization accuracy and robustness of swarming UAVs. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {According to the characteristics of the bionic curved compound eye with many sub-eyes and multi-channel imaging, the method of multi-camera bionic curved compound eye calibration and target positioning is carried out. Combining the method of triangulation and camera coordinate system mapping under non-parallel binocular perspective, a method of bionic curved surface compound eye target positioning method is proposed. According to the requirement of compound eye positioning to have a large overlapping field of view between sub-eyes, a 17-eye bionic curved compound eye with a total field of view over 180° is designed with Unity3D simulation software, and a physical prototype is prepared. Through the ZHANG Zhengyou calibration method, the single target calibration of 17 sub-eyes in the compound eye system and the calibration between 38 pairs of adjacent sub-eyes are completed. On this basis, based on the large overlapping field of view between adjacent sub-eyes of the compound eye, the external parameter calibration method of non-adjacent sub-eyes is proposed to realize the unification of the compound eye coordinate system. Through the establishment of an experimental platform, combined with the ORB feature matching method optimized by RANSAC, a compound-eye prototype is used to perform three-dimensional positioning experiments on the unmanned aerial vehicle models at different positions, and then the error analysis of the positioning results is carried out. The experiments prove that the proposed compound eye calibration and target positioning method is applied to the prototype, which can achieve high precision and large field of view target positioning. © 2021, Science Press.

The main goal is to fully cover the map, maintaining a uniform distribution of the fleet on the map, and avoiding collisions between vehicles and other obstacles. This specific task is suitable for surveillance applications, where the uniform distribution of the fleet in the map permits them to reach any position on the map as fast as possible in emergency scenarios. To solve this problem, a bioinspired neural network structure is adopted. Specifically, the neural network consists of a grid of neurons, where each neuron has a local cost and has a local connection only with neighbor neurons. The cost of each neuron influences the cost of its neighbors, generating an attractive contribution to unvisited neurons. We introduce several controls and precautions to minimize the risk of collisions and optimize coverage planning. Then, preliminary simulations are performed in different scenarios by testing the algorithm in four maps and with fleets consisting of 3 to 10 vehicles. Results confirm the ability of the proposed approach to manage and coordinate the fleet providing the full coverage of the map in every tested scenario, avoiding collisions between vehicles, and uniformly distributing the fleet on the map. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the increased use of information and communication technology (ICT) in agriculture applications has led to the definition of the concept of precision farming or equivalently smart agriculture. In this respect, the latest progress in connectivity, automation, images analysis and artificial intelligence allow farmers to monitor all production phases and, due to the help of automatic procedures, determine better treatments for their farms. One of the main objectives of a smart agriculture system is to improve the yield of the field. From this point of view, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a key role in precision farming applications due to the fact that the use of IoT sensors provides precise information about the health of the production. In this paper, the results of the recently concluded R&D project ENOTRIA TELLUS are reported. The project aimed at the development of all hardware/software components for implementing a precision farming architecture allowing the farmers to manage and monitor the vineyards’ health status. The smart architecture combines various sub-systems (web application, local controllers, unmanned aerial vehicles, multi-spectral cameras, weather sensors etc.) and electronic devices, each of them in charge of performing specific operations: remote data analysis, video processing for vegetation analysis, wireless data exchanges and weather and monitoring data evaluation. Two pilot sites were built where the smart architecture was tested and validated in real scenarios. Experimental activities show that the designed smart agriculture architecture allowed the farmers to properly schedule the various phases of cultivation and harvesting. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become essential to promote the digital process of agriculture in the artificial intelligent era. This review aims to clarify the development trends of agricultural UAVs covering the cutting-edge technologies at the research frontiers, as well as technical achievement and transformation at home and abroad. Five typical databases were selected for the document searching, including Web of Science Core Proceedings, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Derwent Innovations Index, the China National Intellectual Property Administration patent database, and World Intellectual Property Organization Patent Scope. A statistical analysis was performed on the journal articles and invention patents related to agricultural UAVs that published in the above-mentioned databases over the past 20 years from 2001 to 2020 using statistical and bibliometric indicators. Two keywords were used in the search strategy, including "drone" and "agriculture". Mathematical statistics showed that agricultural UAVs entered a high speed of research progress since 2014, and then reached a high fever period in 2016-2018. The literature publication per year is 1 232 with 1 970 patents in 2020. More than 4 000 papers and nearly 7 000 patents have been published in total. Europe has a relatively strong research strength for agricultural UAVs. China and the United States were the main research countries on agricultural UAVs, where paper outputs exceeded 45% (China accounts for 21.43% and the United States accounts for 24.60%) of the total, while Chinese, Japanese, and American companies contributed more patents. Particularly, Chinese patents accounted for around 80% of the total. Spain first laid the theoretical foundation for agricultural UAVs. Chinese and American institutions cooperated with each other relatively closely, followed by Australian institutions. The major publications in the field included Remote Sensing, Precision Agriculture and Computers and Electronics in Agriculture. In the past five years, Chinese studies were more active in this field. The subject areas of agricultural UAV papers were mainly related to remote sensing (30.22%) and environmental science (24.79%) in terms of bibliometrics and scientific mapping. The technical areas of patents were mainly related to aircraft and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, specifically including B64D - aircraft for releasing substances (30.03%), B64C - aircraft for special purposes (23.66%), and A01M - liquid spraying equipment (21.01%). Both papers and patents on agricultural UAVs were divided into two aspects: UAV platform construction and agricultural applications. Agricultural applications were further divided into two major purposes: agricultural information collection and transportation. The current research frontier of agricultural drones lied in the mining of agricultural big data and the construction of agricultural digital models, whereas, the practical application was inclined to low-altitude remote sensing spraying and energy endurance. The latest research and technology application were "plant height" and "animal management and care". The application scenarios are ever-increasingly wider and richer with the rise of emerging technologies, such as 5G, Internet of Things, and blockchain. Meanwhile, there are still some difficulties and challenges on the deeper integration of technologies. UAVs can also serve the new promising applications in animal husbandry and fishery in the future. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Localization is one of the essential problems in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other wireless sensor applications. Most traditional range-free localization algorithms ignore the anisotropy factors, which are frequently observed in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and result in low positioning precision. To mitigate the impact of anisotropy on localization, we propose an accurate localization approach based on Reliable Anchor Pair Selection (RAPS) and Quantum-behaved Salp Swarm Algorithm (QSSA) for anisotropic networks. First, the proposed algorithm uses hop count threshold to limit the number of message transmissions between nodes, which assists to decrease communication overhead. Next, based on the geometric constraints, the selected reliable anchor pairs are divided into two types, namely, super anchor pairs and suboptimal ones. Then, we design different distance estimation equations for the reliable anchor pairs to reduce ranging error. Finally, the QSSA is introduced to calculate the coordinates of regular nodes, which tends to lower the impact of anisotropy factors and improve location accuracy. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness against network anisotropy. © 2020},

If there are “flying fire” and other emergencies in the fire extinguishing process, the improved Ant Colony algorithm based on periodically pheromone updating is used to schedule resources including personnel and fire extinguishing materials, so as to improve the efficiency of forest fire-extinguishing resources scheduling in southern China.

	abstract = {Co-location of wind and tidal current turbines (WTs/TCTs) is a new way to improve the economy and reliability of electricity generation from renewable energy sources. In this paper, an optimization model for determining the configuration of a co-located wind/tidal current farm (WF/TCF) is proposed. The objectives include the minimization of the system levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the maximization of the system average power supply reliability (APSR). In the planning area, there are certain zones where there are important restrictions which do not allow WTs/TCTs to be installed. These are called forbidden zones. When deciding the feasible area in the optimization, the complement of the forbidden zones in the planning area is used. The optimization problem is formulated as a coordinate model (CM) and a grid model (GM), both solved by the multi-swarm optimization (MSO) algorithm. The proposed approach is tested in an offshore area of Zhejiang province, China. Simulation results indicate that the co-location of a WF/TCF is an economic-technical efficient approach to harvest marine renewable energy. Also, the MSO algorithm outperforms its counterparts, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithms, in solving the CM and the GM of the WF/TCF layout optimization problem. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article proposes a coordinated management of electrical energy in a steelworks and a wind farm that are connected to the same distribution network. The suggested solution seeks to improve the efficiency of the hot rolling mill, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to minimize the cost of the electrical energy utilized in the manufacture of steel coils, to increase the power system chargeability, and to guarantee power quality. The proposal consists of constituting a virtual plant (comprising the wind farm and the rolling mill) to be managed by a single operator. The approach is mainly focused on the management of the virtual plant reactive power. The algorithm proposed to optimize this reactive power is based on the so-called particle swarm optimization. Three optimization strategies are analyzed: minimization of losses in the distribution network, minimization of the voltage deviation at two of its nodes, and maximization of the displacement factor in both the rolling mill and the wind farm. Energy losses are reduced by up to 20% when adopting the first strategy in comparison to the least efficient case. Voltage variations are kept at less than 1% at both nodes when using the second strategy, whereas deviations between 1% and 5% are obtained when implementing the other two strategies. The study is based on actual measurements and simulation tests.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Mw7.5 Palu-Donggala earthquake occurred on 28 September 2018 and caused significant damage in Palu City and the surrounding Central Sulawesi region of Indonesia. The earthquake initiated a series of catastrophic landslides (classified as flowslides) [1,2], collapsed buildings, and generated tsunami waves that impacted Palu Bay's coast. The earthquake claimed over 4000 lives, making it the deadliest natural disaster of 2018. We performed a post-earthquake field reconnaissance and collected perishable data at the sites of five significant flowslides (named for the communities where they occurred: Balaroa, Petobo, Lolu Village, Jono Oge, and Sibalaya), as well as at other damage locations in the mesoseismal region. Our field team consisted of five U.S.-based members, who were sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation-supported Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) organization [3], in collaboration with geologists, geotechnical engineers, and other researchers from Indonesia's Center for Earthquake Studies (PusGen) and the Indonesian Society of Geotechnical Engineers (HATTI) [this international team is collectively referred to as the Palu Earthquake “;GEER” team]. The GEER team arrived at Palu City on 13 November 2018 and conducted five days of extensive fieldwork using instrumentation from the Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Facility (known as the “RAPID”) [4,5], including mobile data collection software, digital imaging systems, high-resolution Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennas, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or “;drones”). The resulting dataset includes over 2000 geotagged photographs, UAV images, ground coordinates, and other field measurements and observations, as well as associated post-processed geospatial data products (point clouds, digital surface models, orthomosaic images). Additionally, we used remote sensing data (i.e., pre- and post-event satellite imagery) to generate displacement vectors for over 1200 structures affected by the flowslides. The complete reconnaissance dataset is openly available on DesignSafe [6]. The data collected by the field team and subsequent mapping efforts, which document the morphology and patterns of movements of the flowslides, may be used by researchers studying liquefaction-induced flowslides. In addition, the displacement mapping provides a unique dataset for researchers who are calibrating and verifying simulation models of landslide displacements, or who are seeking a validation dataset for image correlation analysis (including machine learning routines). This dataset is associated with original research presented in “;East Palu Valley Flowslides Induced by the 2018 MW 7.5 Palu-Donggala Earthquake” [1] and also is the basis of research presented by Gallant et al. [2]. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has become a priority in the industrial and academic research community for the last few years. With the fast development of wireless networking technologies, it is widely used in many applications such as surveillance, search and rescue (SAR) operation, disaster management, remote monitoring, and so forth. Emergency communication for victims and first responders is one of the critical requirements during natural and human-made disasters. Airborne Base Stations (BS) or UAV-mounted BS has been used to provide high-speed internet services and rescue responses in natural disasters and emergencies in recent years. Most of the previous research on UAV-mounted BS (UAVmBS) only considers outdoor users. It assumes their coordinate position in a two-dimensional (2D) plane, taking only Euclidean pathloss-based distance into account. Though, in man-made or urban natural disaster situations such as floods, cyclones, building fires, and so forth, users are stuck in single or multistory high-rise buildings situated in a three-dimensional (3D) plane. In such cases, it is possible to interact and rescue reliably if pathloss features are known a priori, both for UAVmBS to users (downlink) and vice versa (uplink). As pathloss in the above situations is a mixture of outdoor and indoor elements, adopting a compatible model can be challenging for communications. This article proposes a layered architecture and studies the path loss models best suited for the disaster management system (DMS), which considers both indoor and outdoor parameters. Further, the main goal is to effectively implement a layered architecture employing UAVmBS in urban disasters for better capacity and coverage improvement. Simulation outputs display the progress in transmission delays, throughput, and effective packet delivery for disaster management. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: Over the past few years, the large-scale popularization of smart terminal devices has introduced a wide range of services, including indoor positioning. Indoor positioning systems that are based on visible light communication have four advantages over indoor positioning systems that are based on radio-frequency communication technology: 1) Centimeter-level positioning accuracy can be achieved; 2) They have high bandwidth and support high-speed data transmission; 3) There is no electromagnetic wave radiation, so they can be used directly in gas stations, operating rooms, and other places where electromagnetic radiation is prohibited; 4) They use mainly line-of-sight communication. Because of these advantages, indoor positioning based on visible light communication has gradually become a research hotspot. Currently, fingerprint positioning based on compressed sensing has two problems: 1) Using the linear least squares method to reconstruct the signal can easily fall into the local optimal solution, resulting in large positioning errors; 2) Large observation values are required to improve the accuracy of reconstructed signals, that is, a high-density light emitting diode (LED) layout is required. To solve the two abovementioned problems, a visible light positioning algorithm based on particle swarm optimization compressed sensing (PSO-CS) is proposed that aims to provide a high-precision positioning method under low-density LED layout. Methods: The research methods for visible light positioning propose in this paper are mainly based on compressed sensing and particle swarm optimization. First, based on the reconstructed and measured received signal strength (RSS) values, a fitness function based on the matched RSS residual is established. Second, based on the sparsity of the location fingerprints, the problem of solving the weight of fingerprint positioning is transformed into the problem of reconstructing the sparse matrix. Third, based on the inner product of the measurement matrix and the observation vector, the energy of the inner product is arranged from high to low to obtain the four fingerprint points with the highest energy value. Finally, combined with particle swarm optimization, the weight vector of four fingerprint points close to the target is reconstructed and the coordinates of the target are calculated. Results and Discussion: The simulation results show that the average positioning error of the PSO-CS algorithm is significantly lower than that of K-nearest neighbor (KNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), random forests (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), reweighted l1-norm minimization (RWl1M), and basis pursuit (BP) algorithms. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range (5 dB-20 dB), even if the grid spacing is 50 cm, the average positioning error of the PSO-CS algorithm is still better than that of the Newton-Raphson (NR) and linear least square (LLS) positioning algorithms (Fig. 3). When the SNR is between 10 dB and 20 dB, the cumulative distribution of positioning errors made by the PSO-CS algorithm is significantly better than that of the other 10 algorithms (Fig. 4). Even in the low-density LED layout, the average positioning error based on the PSO-CS algorithm is still low (Fig. 8). The PSO-CS algorithm has good robustness. Even if the grid spacing is 50 cm and the fingerprint sampling rate is only 50%, the average positioning error curve fluctuation is still small, even after execution is repeated 50 times. When the SNR is 10 dB, the variance is 2.54 cm, and when the SNR is 20 dB, the variance is 1.38 cm. The variance in both cases is very small (Fig. 9 and Fig. 10). When the grid spacing is 50 cm and the SNR is 10 dB, compared with KNN, ELM, RF, ANN, WKNN, OMP, RWl1M, BP, NR, and LLS algorithms, the average positioning errors of PSO-CS algorithm are reduced by 75.88%, 89.15%, 85.44%, 90.25%, 58.05%, 80.82%, 86.29%, 80.01%, 73.57%, and 76.56%, respectively (Table 2). When its positioning accuracy is similar to that of the PSO-CS algorithm, the WKNN algorithm requires 34.3 times more fingerprints than the PSO-CS algorithm, and WKNN's average calculation time is 2.5 times higher than PSO-CS's (Table 3). Conclusion: In this paper, a novel particle swarm optimization compressed sensing algorithm is proposed and successfully applied to visible light positioning based on location fingerprints. Because only four neighbor fingerprints are required to participate in positioning, the dimension value of the swarm search is 4. The weight value of the fingerprint points is between 0 and 1; that is, the search space of the swarm is between 0 and 1. The dimensions and space are very small, so the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is low. This allows it to meet real-time positioning requirements. The simulation results show that even in the low signal-to-noise ratio and low-density LED layout, the average positioning error of the proposed algorithm is still low, and it remains significantly lower than that of similar algorithms. This paper also analyzes the influence of grid spacing, swarm size, sparsity, number of LEDs, and fingerprint sampling rate on positioning errors in the PSO-CS algorithm. The results obtained can provide a useful reference for the design of a practical visible light positioning system. © 2021, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be useful in many different scenarios including disaster management. UAVs can immediately reach the disaster area and collect data that can help relief and rescue activities. Nevertheless, these advantages can be further improved when multiple UAVs coordinate for data collection from different vantage points simultaneously. However, seamless, high-bandwidth communication between UAVs is required for this coordination. Nonetheless, due to the scarcity of bandwidth, a UAV network operating on an unlicensed ISM band may not be feasible. In this article, we follow a conceptual approach in which UAVs can access the licensed spectrum opportunistically. However, it is highly likely that various UAVs may have different sets of approved channels available and are unable to coordinate. Therefore, UAVs are divided into clusters to establish coordination in this scenario based on the availability of a common channel between different UAVs. Clustering based on a single common channel may still not be practical, due to the sporadic availability of common channels that often causes reclustering. Therefore, we present a multi-UAV clustering scheme in which clusters of UAVs are established with more common channels to prevent repeated reclustering by having one main channel and the rest as backup channels. However, this may reduce the size of the cluster which can be addressed by limiting the number of backup channels. In this article, we present two variants of the proposed scheme: Multi-UAV clustering-I and multi-UAV clustering-II. The multi-UAV clustering-I scheme attempts to cluster UAVs with as many common channels as possible, whereas the multi-UAV clustering-II scheme attempts to limit the number of common channels to two. In addition, we propose a method for choosing the main channel from the different channels, where these channels are rated on the basis of bandwidth capacity and the channel with the highest rank is selected as the main channel. The remaining and the rest of the channels are kept as a backup. Simulation results demonstrate smooth and high-bandwidth communication among UAVs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have rapidly become popular for monitoring, delivery, and actuation in many application domains such as environmental management, disaster mitigation, homeland security, energy, transportation, and manufacturing. However, the UAV perception and navigation intelligence (PNI) designs are still in their infancy and demand fundamental performance and energy optimizations to be eligible for mass adoption. In this article, we present a generalizable three-stage optimization framework for PNI systems that (i) abstracts the high-level programs representing the perception, mining, processing, and decision making of UAVs into complex weighted networks tracking the interdependencies between universal low-level intermediate representations; (ii) exploits a differential geometry approach to schedule and map the discovered PNI tasks onto an underlying manycore architecture. To mine the complexity of optimal parallelization of perception and decision modules in UAVs, this proposed design methodology relies on an Ollivier-Ricci curvature-based load-balancing strategy that detects the parallel communities of the PNI applications for maximum parallel execution, while minimizing the inter-core communication; and (iii) relies on an energy-aware mapping scheme to minimize the energy dissipation when assigning the communities onto tile-based networks-on-chip. We validate this approach based on various drone PNI designs including flight controller, path planning, and visual navigation. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework achieves 23% flight time reduction and up to 34% energy savings for the flight controller application. In addition, the optimization on a 16-core platform improves the on-time visit rate of the path planning algorithm by 14% while reducing 81% of run time for ConvNet visual navigation. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.},

For this purpose, a study of the existing techniques for both problems is carried out and an innovative strategy based on Fast Marching Square—for the planning phase—and a simple priority-based speed control—as the method for conflict resolution—is proposed, together with prevention measures designed to try to limit and reduce the greatest number of conflicting situations that may occur between vehicles while they carry out their missions in a simulated 3D urban environment. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated successfully on the basis of certain conveniently chosen statistical measures that are collected throughout the simulation runs. © 2021 by the authors.

By dividing the target area, the neural network mapping relationship between the signal and the position of the radiation source is constructed, and the particle swarm algorithm is used to adjust the weight coefficient of the neural network to realize the sense of the target position. Preliminary determination of the region of interest, and then further high-precision direct positioning within the determined region of interest, can effectively improve the positioning accuracy of the system and reduce the positioning time, which has engineering application value.

	abstract = {In edge computing, how to save energy among sustainable edge nodes is a hot topic. ON/OFF switching of edge nodes as a key point is efficient but still suffers from the long round-trip time problem because of its centralized control manner. Especially in the wireless network, service coverage is proved to be NP-Complete. To this end, we propose a Distributed Swarm intelligence-based Energy-saving algorithm (DSE). In DSE, pheromone and residual energy are used to calculate the wake-up probability. Through the wake-up probability, the edge node can be activated periodically and efficiently. In order to balance the energy in the whole system that contains massive edge nodes, we further use a correction factor, that is, DSE+, to adjust the wake-up probability of the nodes. The proposed methods allow for distributed implementation without requiring a centralized control by the coordinator, and the pheromone accumulated temporally and spatially. In addition, they do not require node localization. Experiments show that both DSE and DSE+ can work as expected, and DSE+ with the correction factor improves the lifetime of the whole system at least 12.6% compared with the DSE without the correction factor. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aiming at shortcomings in the traditional research methods of outcrops, using the agility, overall perspective and high-degree quantification of UAV oblique photography, the authors have completed the collection, processing and geological interpretation of delta outcrops, and established the three-dimensional digitized outcrop model and quantitative geological knowledge database of reservoirs. Through the fine analysis and comparative study of multiple outcrop sections, and the use of such methods as lithofacies combination, hierarchical interface, interaction of plane and section, sequential indicator stochastic simulation and multiple-point geostatistical simulation, this study establishes the three-dimensional multiple-point statistical model of the outcrop area. The study shows that: (1) The three-dimensional coordinate system of the oblique photographic data collected by UAV after processing is fully coupled with the information of high-precision images, realizing the three-dimensional digitalization, visualization and quantification of the geological information of outcrops. Under the setting of well points, in combination with the lithofacies constraints of well point, this paper carries out a comparison of outcrops with cross-well base-level cycles and the tracking of substrata, and establishes the spatial stratigraphic framework and quantitative reservoir geological knowledge database of the outcrop area. (2) Combining the analysis of traditional outcrop sections and the quantitative reservoir geological knowledge database of modern UAV oblique photography is a complementary means of establishing the spatial distribution of geological attributes and geological models in the study area, which improves the rationality of research results. Three types of genetic sandbodies with great differences in architecture is developed from bottom to top in the outcrop area, i.e., crossed-superimposed distributary channels, distributary channels superimposed with sheet sand bars, and skeletal sandbodies such as thin sheet sandbody or isolated distributary channels. (3) UAV oblique photography model expands the study of two-dimensional irregular outcrop sections into three-dimensional space, and establishes a three-dimensional sequential indicator stochastic simulation model, which not only enhances the correlation between the sections, but also provides strong support for studying the plane sedimentary microfacies of outcrops, and finely describing the distribution of sandbody architecture by the interaction of plane and section. (4)Based on the interaction of plane and section, as well as data from the quantitative reservoir geological knowledge database, this paper determines the structure model of three-dimensional training images, finally conducts three-dimensional multiple-point statistical simulation, and explores the facies-controlling porosity parameters and "sweet spot" distribution rules. The results show that there are small differences in the realization of the multiple-point model, the distribution of sand bodies in each layer, the quantitative reservoir geological knowledge database, and also the statistical data values of various models; the model achieved by multiple-point 3D simulation is highly reliable. © 2021, Editorial Office of ACTA PETROLEI SINICA.

	abstract = {Introduction: Drones can transmit live video and geographic coordinates during the planning stages for search and rescue operations and the operations themselves. There are few simulation studies in which drones provided rescue support. However, the literature does not contain any simulation studies involving the use of drones to locate lost “victims” represented by dummies in rivers. We developed a simulation model to compare the first visual contact times for drone-assisted search techniques (DAST) and classic search techniques (CST). Methods: In this prospective experimental simulation study, we used both DAST and CST to perform a series of river searches for unconscious victims (represented by dummies). We calculated the first visual contact times, total scanned area, scanned area per minute, flight-walking distances, and flight-walking speeds and compared the results between both groups. The data are presented as mean±SD. Results: We performed 20 search and rescue operations, 10 with the CST and 10 with the DAST. The time to reach the victim was 823±177 s using CST and 80±14 s using DAST. The area scanned by unit time was 3091±54 m2·min-1 using CST and 22,640±1622 m2·min-1 using DAST. Conclusions: The drone-assisted search technique located a simulated victim drifting in a river faster than the classic search technique. The use of drones in search and rescue operations could improve the time to find victims. © 2022 Wilderness Medical Society},

	abstract = {With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Target maneuver trajectory prediction plays an important role in air combat situation awareness and threat assessment. To solve the problem of low prediction accuracy of the traditional prediction method and model, a target maneuver trajectory prediction model based on phase space reconstruction-radial basis function (PSR-RBF) neural network is established by combining the characteristics of trajectory with time continuity. In order to further improve the prediction performance of the model, the rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL) algorithm is introduced to determine the structure of RBF, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and the hybrid algorithm of the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the k-means are introduced to optimize the parameter of RBF, and a PSR-RBF neural network is constructed. An independent method of 3D coordinates of the target maneuver trajectory is proposed, and the target manuver trajectory sample data is constructed by using the training data selected in the air combat maneuver instrument (ACMI), and the maneuver trajectory prediction model based on the PSR-RBF neural network is established. In order to verify the precision and real-time performance of the trajectory prediction model, the simulation experiment of target maneuver trajectory is performed. The results show that the prediction performance of the independent method is better, and the accuracy of the PSR-RBF prediction model proposed is better. The prediction confirms the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method and model. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.},

The considered problem is solved by a multi-UAV deployment method based on Double Coordinate System Particle Swarm Optimization (DCS-PSO) algorithm. Firstly, an optimization problem is constructed by taking the average Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) of the surveillance area as the objective function, considering the limited communication distance and the irregular convex deployment area as the constraint conditions. Then, a modified particle initialization method is studied to initialize all particles within the irregular convex deployment area. Moreover, DCS-PSO algorithm based on the modified particle initialization method is proposed simultaneously to solve the optimal multi-UAV deployment problem. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the modified particle initialization method is successfully accessible to initialize all particles within irregular convex deployment area, show that DCS-PSO is valid and robust under different irregular convex deployment area, and prove that the DCS-PSO algorithm steeply outperforms external illuminators (EI) method based on penalty function. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Offshore wind farm (OWF) protection is of major concern for power engineers now days. In a radial structure of OWF the coordination between protective devices is generally done at AC side of the system. But a major challenge involved with this is that coordination between protective devices is lost. This happens because unidirectional flow of power is lost and the short circuit level also changes. Further the relay setting fluctuates when OWF are connected to onshore grid through voltage source converter-high voltage direct current (VSCHVDC). For effective relay coordination a large number of coordination constraints should be taken for the formulation of objective function. This paper investigates the performance achieved by performing distance and overcurrent relay coordination on the basis of faults simulated at both near and far-ends. This research work proposes application of a new hybrid optimization technique particle swarm optimization gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA) in relay coordination problem.

This paper presents an elicitation study that showed firefighters’ desires to collaborate with autonomous drones. We developed a Human–Drone interaction (HDI) method for indicating a target to a drone using 3D pointing gestures estimated solely from a monocular camera. The participant first points to a window without using any wearable or body-attached device. Through the drone’s front-facing camera, the drone detects the gesture and computes the target window. This work includes a description of the process for choosing the gesture, detecting and localizing objects, and carrying out the transformations between coordinate systems. Our proposed 3D pointing gesture interface improves on 2D interfaces by integrating depth information with SLAM and solving ambiguity with multiple objects aligned on the same plane in a large-scale outdoor environment. Experimental results showed that our 3D pointing gesture interface obtained average F1 scores of 0.85 and 0.73 for precision and recall in simulation and real-world experiments and an F1 score of 0.58 at the maximum distance of 25 m between the drone and building. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Localization also benefits in recognizing the geographically area where an event took place. There is no meaning of any event information without the knowledge of its location coordinates. DV-Hop is one of the main range free localization technique, which estimates the position of nodes using distance vector. Particle swarm optimization is suitable for the localization issues because of its fast computing speed and high precision. To further reduce the positioning error, the traditional DV-Hop localization algorithm based on single objective optimization algorithm is converted into a multi objective optimization algorithm. In our proposed scheme, we have considered six different single objective functions and three different multi objective functions. In this paper, a multi objective particle swarm optimization based DV-Hop localization is proposed in 3-dimensional wireless sensor networks. The proposed functions has been evaluated on the basis of computation time, average localization error and localization error variance. The simulation results show that our proposed multi objective function performs better as compared to traditional single objective function. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Target tracking is a typical application of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). However, it is difficult for the existing guidance laws to meet the requirements of convergence speed and tracking accuracy at the same time. A new guidance law based on a coordinated turning equation is proposed to achieve target tracking, and its asymptotic stability is proved. Linear analysis is provided to help select the control parameters. This guidance law is improved to track the moving ground object with time-varying states. Compared with existing methods through numerical simulations, the proposed guidance law offers a faster convergence speed and a higher level of precision. The effectiveness and robustness of the guidance law in different situations are verified by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. © 2021 ISA},

	abstract = {The past few years have witnessed unprecedented proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).They are employed in a growing number of scenarios, from parcel delivery to search and rescue operations, requiring coordinated missions of a fleet of drones. Recently, there has been growing interest in optimized techniques to assign tasks and related trajectories to drones. While these techniques promise high coverage of inspected area, their applicability in real scenarios is precluded by unconsidered constraints. Among these, the limited amount of power of UAVs, and the consequent need of performing multiple trips to provide complete monitoring coverage, with battery replacement/charging and data offloading in between.To address this problem we develop Gen-Path, a genetic algorithm for efficient scheduling of multi-round UAV missions, under several objective functions.By means of simulations we show that Gen-Path fits various scenarios, improving existing solutions in terms of covered points, and energetic cost. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Floods are the most common disaster in the world and cause deaths, damages to houses, buildings, and possessions, as well as disruption to communications. In such dynamic scenarios, it is needed to search and track mobile objects transported by the water flows, such as humans, animals, vehicles, and debris. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is essential in disaster scenarios to help first responders determine correct procedures in terms of searching, tracking, and rescuing the victims, as well as in defining the actions to minimize the risks in a sustainable and timely manner. However, the tracking of mobile objects and the delivery of real-time video sequences from UAVs with energy constraints toward first responders is still a hard task. Therefore, it is necessary to orchestrate a swarm of UAVs for searching and tracking objects while reacting fast to frequent changes in the topology and trajectory, as well as distributing real-time video flows with quality level support to the ground team. This article proposes an energy-aware swarm-based and mobility prediction scheme for UAVs, called SUAV. SUAV provides a unique UAV-based system for rescue scenarios with mobile objects and with support for route and path planning, searching and tracking procedures, mobility prediction and multi-hop communication management, video delivery with Quality of Service (QoS)/Quality of Experience (QoE) support, and energy-efficiency. Simulation results show the efficiency of SUAV in transmitting real-time video flows with QoS/QoE support while minimizing the energy consumption in flooding scenarios with mobile targets.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, optimal location and capacity of the BESS with wind power penetrations, and charging/discharging dispatches of BESS are determined using inherited competitive swarm optimization (ICSO) algorithm while improving the performance of the unbalanced distribution network subject to technical constraints. The strategy uses the average load of the feeder as the deciding criterion for charging or discharging the battery. The sustainable average load (SAL) charging method is utilized to charge the battery. The free-running and conservative discharging methods of the battery are studied. The proposed methodology is investigated on IEEE 37 bus unbalanced radial distribution system.

These jobs can either be executed locally, or sent to a centralized cloud platform that can execute them at greater speed. Such edge-generated jobs may come from various applications, such as e-health, disaster recovery, autonomous vehicles or flying drones. The problem is to decide where and when to schedule each job, with the objective to minimize the maximum stretch incurred by any job. The stretch of a job is the ratio of the time spent by that job in the system, divided by the minimum time it could have taken if the job was alone in the system. We formalize the problem and explain the differences with other models that can be found in the literature. We prove that minimizing the max-stretch is NP-complete, even in the simpler instance with no release dates (all jobs are known in advance). This result comes from the proof that minimizing the max-stretch with homogeneous processors and without release dates is NP-complete, a complexity problem that was left open before this work. We design several algorithms to propose efficient solutions to the general problem, and we conduct simulations based on real platform parameters to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Drones are frequently used for the delivery of materials or other goods, and to facilitate the capture and transmission of data. Moreover, drone networks have gained significant interest in a number of scenarios, such as in quarantined or isolated areas, following technical damage due to a disaster, or in non-urbanized areas without communication infrastructure. In this context, we propose a network of drones that are able to fly on a map covered by regular polygons, with a well-established mobility schedule, to carry and transfer data. Two means exist to equidistantly cover an area with points, namely, grouping the points into equilateral triangles or squares. In this study, a network of drones that fly in an aerial area divided into squares was proposed and investigated. This network was compared with the case in which the area is divided into equilateral triangles. The cost of the square drone network was lower than that of the triangular network with the same cell length, but the efficiency factors were better for the latter. Two situations related to increasing the drone autonomy using drone charging or battery changing stations were analyzed. This study proposed a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) to optimize the transmission of data. Multiple simulation studies based on experimental flight tests were performed using the proposed algorithm versus five traditional DTN methods. A light Wi-Fi Arduino development board was used for the data transfer between drones and stations using delivery protocols. The efficiency of data transmission using single-copy and multiple-copy algorithms was analyzed. Simulation results showed a better performance of the proposed Time-Dependent Drone (TD-Drone) Dijkstra algorithm compared with the Epidemic, Spray and Wait, PRoPHET, MaxProp, and MaxDelivery routing protocols. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Energy and cost are two primary concerns when leveraging drones for urban sensing. With the advances of wireless charging technologies and the inspiration from the sparse crowdsensing paradigm, this paper proposes a novel drone-based collaborative sparse-sensing framework DroneSense, demonstrating its feasibility for sustainable urban-scale sensing. We focus on a typical use case, i.e., leveraging DroneSense to sense open parking spaces. DroneSense selects a minimum number of Points of Interest (POIs) to schedule drones for physical data sensing and then infers the parking occupancy of the remaining POIs to meet the overall quality requirement. However, drone-based sensing is different from human-centric crowdsensing, resulting in a series of new problems, including which POIs are visited first, when and where to charge drones, which drones to charge first, how much to charge, and when to stop the scheduling. To this end, we design a holistic solution, including context-aware matrix factorization for parking occupancy data inference, progressive determination of task quantity, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based task selection, energy-aware DRL-based task scheduling, and adaptive charger scheduling. Extensive experiments with a real-world on-street parking dataset from Shenzhen, China demonstrate the obvious advantages of DroneSense. © 2022 IEEE.},

Many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, but they largely compromise system characteristics such as fault tolerance, capacity, efficiency, and in particular cost, since real implementations require special hardware. This paper proposes a coordination strategy for a system composed of small robots of minimalist design under the condition of minimum processing and sensing capacity. The communication requirements have been limited to a local communication strategy sufficient to achieve the relative orientation of each swarm member. The usefulness of the scheme is evaluated by simulation in specialized search tasks in an unknown region. The results show the high capability of the scheme and the ease of implementation on real prototypes.  © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {As the emergency power supply for a simulation substation, lead-acid batteries have a work pattern featuring noncontinuous operation, which leads to capacity regeneration. However, the accurate estimation of battery state of charge (SOC), a measurement of the amount of energy available in a battery, remains a hard nut to crack because of the non-stationarity and randomness of battery capacity change. This paper has proposed a comprehensive method for lead-acid battery SOC estimation, which may aid in maintaining a reasonable charging schedule in a simulation substation and improving battery’s durability. Based on the battery work pattern, an improved Ampere-hour method is used to calculate the SOC during constant current and constant voltage (CC/CV) charging and discharging. In addition, the combined Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model is used to estimate the SOC during non-CC discharging. Experimental results show that this method is workable in online SOC estimation of working batteries in a simulation substaion, with the maximum relative error standing at only 2.1% during the non-training period, indicating a high precision and wide applicability. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {In this study, we propose an algorithm for selecting nodes with the minimum dilution of precision (DOP) to improve the accuracy of estimating the location of an unknown signal source in a swarm drone environment. The pulse radar emits a narrow beam, and the swarm drones receive the emitted pulses at different times. The ground control station derives the time difference between the received signals based on the PRI. For accurate location estimation of the signal source using time difference of arrival (TDOA), a plane perpendicular to the vector connecting the estimated location coordinates of the signal source and center of gravity of the swarm drone is determined. The swarm drones are orthogonally projected on the determined plane, and a reference node that can reduce the DOP is selected by dividing the plane. Then, the location of the TDOA-based signal source is estimated by selecting a set of nodes that forms the minimum DOP with the reference node. The receiving nodes with the minimum DOP were selected among the deployed swarm drones, and it was confirmed using MATLAB simulation to effectively estimate the location of the signal source.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work investigates a combined internal combustion engine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) hybrid powertrain for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). UAVs are increasingly used in large agriculture for crop management and water resource visual inspection, and in militarized applications, as they allow for safer, unmanned reconnaissance missions. The limited flight time of UAVs, as a result of the traditional lithium polymer batteries used for power, has restricted the widespread implementation of the UAV technology. A hybrid power train, utilizing energy dense liquid fuel, provides the capability of powering a UAV for longer duration missions. The hybrid power train consists of a small internal combustion engine that acts as a partial oxidation fuel reformer, simultaneously producing mechanical shaft power. The 0.3 in3 piston engine is a typical air cooled, glow engine utilizing a 60/40 percent (by volume) mixture of methanol and nitromethane, respectively. The syngas generated by the combustion engine can then be utilized by a tubular SOFC stack to generate electrical energy for the UAV flight systems. The SOFC system operating on combustion exhaust from the engine produced a maximum of ~650 mW/cm2, while the engine was continually producing ~750 W of mechanical shaft power. In case of an engine failure, the liquid fuel may be directly utilized by the SOFC system to maintain power generation. Additionally, the engine may be manually shutdown to provide silent onboard power generation. In testing, a tubular SOFC provided with direct liquid 60/40 methanol/nitromethane fuel was capable of producing above 550 mW/cm2 for maximum power. The SOFC system was able to operate continuously under direct liquid fueling for 4 hours without degradation. The power produced by the proposed hybrid powertrain is expected to be sufficient to power a 15 kg UAV for long endurance missions lasting in the range of 200-500% of current recorded UAV flight duration. © 2021 SAE International.

To provide safe and self-sustainable operations, each UAV has to make an online decision of mode switching to decide whether to continue to serve the users (service mode) or to return to the charging station (charging mode). Fueled by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we resolve the trajectory planning problem in a distributed and coordinated manner, which enables the UAVs to adapt to the network conditions rapidly as well as consider the recharging constraint.

	abstract = {Robots in swarms take advantage of localization infrastructure, such as a motion capture system or global positioning system (GPS) sensors to obtain their global position, which can then be communicated to other robots for swarm coordination. However, the availability of localization infrastructure needs not to be guaranteed, e.g., in GPS-denied environments. Likewise, the communication overhead associated with broadcasting locations may be undesirable. For reliable and versatile operation in a swarm, robots must sense each other and interact locally. Motivated by this requirement, we propose an onboard relative localization framework for multirobot systems. The setup consists of an anchor robot with three onboard ultrawideband (UWB) sensors and a tag robot with a single onboard UWB sensor. The anchor robot utilizes the three UWB sensors to estimate the tag robot's location by using its onboard sensing and computational capabilities solely, without explicit interrobot communication. Because the anchor UWB sensors lack the physical separation that is typical in fixed UWB localization systems, we introduce filtering methods to improve the estimation of the tag's location. In particular, we utilize a mixture Monte Carlo localization (MCL) approach to capture maneuvers of the tag robot with acceptable precision. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm with simulations as well as indoor and outdoor field experiments on a two-drone setup. The proposed mixture MCL algorithm yields highly accurate estimates for various speed profiles of the tag robot and demonstrates superior performance over the standard particle filter and the extended Kalman filter.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be flexibly deployed to offload cellular traffic or to provide video services for emergency scenarios without infrastructure. However, the inherent resource allocation and three-dimensional (3D) aerial trajectory design have not been formally studied. In this paper, we study the joint resource allocation and 3D aerial trajectory design for dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH)-enabled services in a UAV communication system, where a UAV is employed as a base station for multiuser video streaming. Various factors are taken into account, including video data rate, quality variation, communication outage, play interruption, etc. By adopting a video streaming utility model, two fundamental problems are formulated with different practical aims: the first problem maximizes the minimum utility for all users within a given time horizon such that max-min fairness can be provided, and the second problem minimizes the UAV operation time subject to the individual utility requirement for all users to prolong UAV endurance. To tackle the first non-convex problem, we decouple it into three sub-problems, and a three-stage iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution by solving the three sub-problems with successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. An exponential search based algorithm is proposed for the second problem by utilizing the structure of the considered problem and a similar three-stage iterative algorithm. Extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance, and the results show that our proposed designs significantly outperform baseline schemes. Furthermore, our results reveal new insights of UAV movement for video streaming and unveil the tradeoff between utility and quality variance. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

Nevertheless, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are still skeptical to revise their business in this direction because of the absence of deep studies showing its effectiveness in real deployments leveraging local computing environments. To bridge this gap, this article presents a quantitative cross-comparison of cutting-edge technologies for container networking (including Docker as a container engine, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes as orchestrators, bare-metal and OpenStack cloud as deployment platform), properly integrated to realize a virtualized service infrastructure within a commercial workstation. Initial experimental tests are conducted to identify the most suitable combination of technologies for high-load environments, where many clients contact the virtualized service infrastructure to download files of large size. Obtained results demonstrate that the combination of Docker and Kubernetes generally ensures better performance on the bare-metal deployment platform, thus emerging as mature and effective solutions to be used by SMEs. Finally, the behavior of the identified virtualized service infrastructure is also evaluated in a smart farm use case, where containers are in charge of processing images provided by mobile drones for monitoring purposes. In addition, in this case, the conducted study highlights the promising capability offered by container networking in real deployments, exploiting local computing environments. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster, and it is crucial to search and track the objects transported by the water flows, such as humans, animals, vehicles, and debris. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is essential in disaster scenarios to help first responders in determining correct procedures in terms of searching, tracking, and rescuing the victims, as well as in defining the actions to minimize the risks in a sustainable and timely manner. However, the tracking of mobile objects for UAVs is challenging because it is necessary to change the UAVs' topology frequently to organize them according to the target object's new location and the rescue team's position. It is also mandatory to assure the distribution of real-time video flows with a high-quality level and a minimal delay in mobile environments and save scarce energy power. This paper proposes a swarm-based and mobility prediction algorithm for UAVs, called SUAV, to efficiently orchestrate UAVs to track mobile objects in flooding scenarios while saving energy and delivering real-time videos with Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) assurance to first responders. Simulation results present the impact and the benefits of our proposal in delivering videos with QoE and QoS support compared to state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Reliable communication and intensive computing power cannot be provided effectively by temporary hot spots in disaster areas and complex terrain ground infrastructure. Mitigating this has greatly developed the application and integration of UAV and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to the Internet of Things (IoT). However, problems such as multi-user and huge data flow in large areas, which contradict the reality that a single UAV is constrained by limited computing power, still exist. Due to allowing UAV collaboration to accomplish complex tasks, cooperative task offloading between multiple UAVs must meet the interdependence of tasks and realize parallel processing, which reduces the computing power consumption and endurance pressure of terminals. Considering the computing requirements of the user terminal, delay constraint of a computing task, energy constraint, and safe distance of UAV, we constructed a UAV-Assisted cooperative offloading energy efficiency system for mobile edge computing to minimize user terminal energy consumption. However, the resulting optimization problem is originally nonconvex and thus, difficult to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we developed an energy efficiency optimization algorithm using Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) that decomposes the problem into three convex subproblems. Furthermore, we jointly optimized the number of local computing tasks, number of computing offloaded tasks, trajectories of UAV, and offloading matching relationship between multi-UAVs and multiuser terminals. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is suitable for different channel conditions and significantly saves the user terminal energy consumption compared with other benchmark schemes. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained widespread interest in civilian and military applications, which has led to the development of novel UAVs that can perform various operations. UAVs are aircraft that can fly without the need of a human pilot onboard, meaning they can fly either autonomously or be remotely piloted. They can be equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), LiDAR, and GPS, to collect and transmit data in real time. Due to the demand for UAVs in various applications such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, wireless communications, and surveillance, several types of UAVs have been invented with different specifications for their size, weight, range and endurance, engine type, and configuration. Because of this variety, the design process and analysis are based on the type of UAV, with the availability of several control techniques that could be used to improve the flight of the UAV in order to avoid obstacles and potential collisions, as well as find the shortest path to save the battery life with the support of optimization techniques. However, UAVs face several challenges in order to fly smoothly, including collision avoidance, battery life, and intruders. This review paper presents UAVs’ classification, control applications, and future directions in industry and research interest. For the design process, fabrication, and analysis, various control approaches are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges for UAVs, including battery charging, collision avoidance, and security, are also presented and discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, transmission line inspection and maintenance in remote regions are expensive, especially in unmanned regions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) power inspection is significant development towards the space-ground collaborative smart grid. The UAV is used to patrol the power system, and the security problems and fault types can be detected in time by remote video transmission. But in a multi-tasks scenario how to schedule UAVs to complete tasks with the least cost (which can be energy consumption, distance, time) is rarely studied. This paper studies the scheduling problem of multi-machines and multi-tasks in UAVs power inspection, formulates the schedule of UAVs as a multi-traveling salesman problem applied in this scenarios. Two scheduling strategies based on Genetic algorithm and Tabu Search algorithm are proposed to solve the multi-traveling salesman problem. In particular, the Genetic algorithm has a fast convergence speed and a better objective function value. Therefore, it is easier to meet the rapid emergency requirements in the multi-tasks scenarios of the UAVs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone, is an evolving technology in today's market with an enormous number of applications. Mini UAVs are developed in order to compensate the performance constraints imposed by larger UAVs during emergency situations. Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, a Secured UAV (S-UAV) model is proposed which takes the location of the UAVs as inputs to form a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) among multiple drones with the help of a centralized controller. After WMN formation, efficient communication takes place using A∗ search, an intelligent algorithm that finds the shortest communication path among UAVs. Further, the S-UAV model utilizes cryptographic techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Blowfish to overcome the security attacks efficiently. Simulation results show that the S-UAV model offers higher throughput, reduced power consumption and guaranteed message transmission with reduced encryption and decryption time. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of wind turbines to generate electricity is growing worldwide. They comprise an extended area of hundreds of square miles, making the inspection process difficult and time-consuming. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using a drone, or also known as unmanned aircraft systems, for inspecting wind turbines. Motivated by leveraging drone technology, this paper provides a routing optimization model to reduce the total operation time for inspecting a wind farm. We assume that one drone and one ground vehicle which carries the drone and extra batteries and charging equipment are available. The optimization model is solved in two steps. The first step clusters the wind turbines and optimizes the drone routing in each cluster by solving the classical traveling salesman problem using an integer linear programming model. The second step optimizes the ground vehicle routing by solving the equality generalized traveling salesman problem using an integer linear programming model. We test our proposed model using three case studies created by using actual wind farm locations. We compare the results with two models. One model assumes no clustering of the wind turbines, and the other model uses a greedy approach for determining the ground vehicle route. The results show that the proposed model is more efficient at different flight speeds and endurances. Also, we confirm that the efficiency increases as the drone flies faster or it has longer flight endurance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

To help wind energy industries better understand the coordinated operation of BESS and wind farms and its associated profits, this paper develops a simulation model to implement a number of coordination strategies where the BESS supplies enhanced frequency response (EFR) service and enables the time shift of wind generation based on the UK perspective. The proposed model also simulates the degradation of Lithium-Ion battery and incorporates a state of charge (SOC) dependent limit on the charge rate derived from a constant current-constant voltage charging profile. In addition, a particle swarm optimisation-based battery sizing algorithm is developed here on the basis of the simulation model to determine the optimal size of the co-located BESS along with SOC-related strategy variables that maximise the net present value of the wind + BESS system at the end of the EFR contract. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Nowadays with the growing requirements of sustainable development, energy efficiency enhancement plays a crucial role in the petrochemical industries. In fact, the energy efficiency level depends on the coordination management of energy and materials. Therefore, a two-stage optimization scheme with respect to coordination of energy and materials from the entire process to the key sub-process is proposed for improving energy efficiency level of ethylene production. Firstly, a data-driven model for feedstock and plant-level economic indicators and is established by extreme learning machine (ELM) integrated domain adaptive manifold regularization (DAMR) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), called DAMR-PSO-ELM. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model for feedstock proportions is established and a cascading-priority weight strategy is made for obtaining the optimal feedstock proportions under the different market demands. Finally, fuel–feedstock ratio optimization models for cracking furnaces are built with respect to the obtained optimal proportions, and an improved elitist teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm is proposed to acquire the optimal fuel. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed coordinated optimization scheme are validated from a practical ethylene plant, results show that energy consumption of cracking production is reduced by 4.89% and energy efficiency of the entire ethylene process is increased by 6.82% on average. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is becoming used gradually as an alternative source to classical fossil fuel because of being renewable, clean and abundant. In agricultural regions such as Hail, Saudi Arabia, farmers can invest in using PV sources for pumping water from relatively deep wells. In such case, forecasting the potential of PV energy is among the primary factors that may affect the design of a PV water pumping system efficiency and reliability. In this paper, a novel combined method based on Hammerstein—autoregressive with exogenous input—Wiener model optimized by particle swarm optimization was developed. Four models including, saturation, dead-zone and polynomial nonlinear blocks have been evaluated using global horizontal irradiation (GHI) as model output and separately, the temperature, the clearness index, the relative humidity and the wind speed as model inputs on daily basis collected from Hail region, Saudi Arabia over 20 years (2000–2019). The collected 7305 observations were divided into a training subset (6205) and a testing subset (1095). Six other models including persistence forecast, smart persistence forecast, time series autoregressive and artificial neural networks have been also implemented on the same dataset for comparison purpose. Based on robust performance indicators (mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination, the root mean square error and skill score), the Hammerstein–Saturation with temperature as input model outperformed all the other developed models. To validate the suitability of the proposed approach for forecasting GHI in arid climates, our best model was implemented on two locations picked randomly in the Hail region (Saudi Arabia). The results of validation were in the same scale of accuracy as the primary best model. © 2020, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes novel distributed control methods to address coverage and flocking problems in three-dimensional (3D) environments using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Two classes of coverage problems are considered in this work, namely barrier and sweep problems. Additionally, the approach is also applied to general 3D flocking problems for advanced swarm behavior. The proposed control strategies adopt a region-based control approach based on Voronoi partitions to ensure collision-free self-deployment and coordinated movement of all vehicles within a 3D region. It provides robustness for the multi-vehicle system against vehicles’ failure. It is also computationally-efficient to ensure scalability, and it handles obstacle avoidance on a higher level to avoid conflicts in control with the inter-vehicle collision avoidance objective. The problem formulation is rather general considering mobile robots navigating in 3D spaces, which makes the proposed approach applicable to different UAV types and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, implementation details have also been shown considering quadrotor-type UAVs for an example application in precision agriculture. Validation of the proposed methods have been performed using several simulations considering different simulation platforms such as MATLAB and Gazebo. Software-in-the-loop simulations were carried out to asses the real-time computational performance of the methods showing the actual implementation with quadrotors using C++ and the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Good results were obtained validating the performance of the suggested methods for coverage and flocking scenarios in 3D using systems with different sizes up to 100 vehicles. Some scenarios considering obstacle avoidance and robustness against vehicles’ failure were also used. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The application of electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in agricultural remote sensing monitoring is limited by their short endurance. A long-endurance battery-powered light blended-wing-body UAV was designed for agricultural remote sensing. A design method for a light blended-wing-body UAV was proposed. The structural parameters of the light fixed-wing UAV was optimized and a model was built. The aero-dynamic performance of the UAV was determined by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the force distribution in flight state was dynamically analyzed based on fluid-structure interaction model. The results showed that the lift-to-drag ratio of the optimized model was 2.6% higher than that of the initially designed model, and the light blended-wing-body UAV had good aerodynamic characteristics. The pressure distribution of the UAV was effective at a 6° angle of attack and a cruising speed of 15.5 m/s. When the take-off weight was 1.5 kg, the maximum value of pressure on the lower surface of the UAV was 143 Pa, and the lift force was mainly concentrated on the leading edge of the wing. The theoretical endurance time was 65 min, and the maximum stress during the cruising phase was lower than the tensile strength of the fuselage material and the yield strength of the rotor. Under the same conditions, the maximum value of total deformation was 0.288 38 mm. The above parameters all met the normal working conditions of the UAV. Therefore, the structure, materials, and performance of the proposed light agricultural remote sensing UAV were suitable for agricultural remote sensing.

We explicitly deal with a robust scenario in which the measurement is actually perturbed by the noise that grows with the distance to the victim and propose an adaptive control scheme based on a least-square identifier and a trajectory generator whose role is both to guarantee the persistence of excitation for the identifier and to steer the ARVA receiver toward the victim. We prove that the controller ensures boundedness of trajectories and enables to localize the victim in a domain where the ARVA output is sufficiently informative. We illustrate its performance in a realistic simulation framework specifically developed with real data.

In this chapter, we present in the first section some methods of designing swarm robot systems by identifying swarm engineering based on a model (MBSE) and multi-agent simulation. Then, we study the energy problem of these robotic systems and the solution proposed by the researchers. In the second section, we present an application for detecting oil in the sea and cleaning it using swarm robots. We will model this application using the MBSE method with the SysML language. We will use the different diagrams of SysML to specify the system requirements and model the functions offered by the system. Finally, we will simulate the models on a multi-agent tool to identify the functional and structural architecture of the system.

Considering the system's plenty of defects and combining it with the MATLAB/simulink system, such as non-linearity, time-varying, large inertia, uncertain mathematical model and severe lag, a fuzzy proportional integral differential control based on particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper for water and fertilizer integration system. Primarily, the research is done for precision fertilization control of fertilizer integration system and water, and the parameters of fuzzy proportional integral differential gain that schedules controllers are optimized through a particle swarm algorithm. The effectiveness of the suggested controller has been validated by comparing with the control algorithms (proportional integral differential control, fuzzy proportional integral differential control) commonly applied in current fertilizer application systems. Simulation experiments for this research are devised through MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform. Significant improvement in the system's tuning capabilities by incorporating particle swarm algorithm in the hysteretic non-linear system. Eventually, four control algorithms are experimentally validated in this research at different pH values through Experiments čáre designed in the experimental field. The outcomes demonstrate that the control algorithm in this paper possesses better regulation effect, smaller overshoot, excellent stability and more inadequate rising steady state time compared with the previous controls, which can enables precise control of the fertiliser system. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In many edge computing applications, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are required to be coordinated to perform several tasks. Each task is usually modeled as a process that a UAV runs, and could include hovering an area to find survivors after a natural disaster or sense and preprocess an image in cooperation with the edge cloud. Optimally and rapidly (re)assigning tasks to such IoT agents as the network conditions fluctuate and the battery of these agents quickly drains is a challenging problem. Existing solutions designed to proactively offload tasks are either energy unaware or they require solving computationally intensive task, and hence are less portable on constrained IoT devices. In this paper, we propose RITMO, a distributed and adaptive task offloading algorithm that aims to solve these challenges. RITMO exploits a simple yet effective regressor to dynamically predict the length of future UAV task queues. Such prediction is then used to anticipate the node overloading and avoid agents that are likely to exhaust their battery or their computational resources. Our results demonstrate how RITMO helps reduce the overall latency perceived by the application and the energy consumed by the nodes, outperforming recent solutions.  © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mobility is one of the most fascinating features of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support many critical applications (e.g., data dissemination) in emergency scenarios. Communication information in such applications could be confidential, and hence an effective security technique is required to mitigate the presence of an eavesdropper to some extent. On the other hand, blessed by the flexibility in the management and low overhead, physical layer security has received a significant attention in the recent years. To this end, we consider a communication system, in which a sensor-equipped mobile UAV hovers over a region to collect information and then disseminate this information to static a ground network entity in a confidential manner. Because of the popularity and practicality, the UAV is assumed to hover following the random way point (RWP) mobility model. We investigate the secrecy characteristics of the UAV under steady-state running state in terms of positive secrecy capacity probability and secrecy outage probability for the communication between the UAV and the receiver. Because of the intractable singleton analysis owing to the UAV mobility, we derive four separate closed form expressions of these performance metrics in four quadrants of conventional coordinate systems. We then investigate the secrecy performance of the UAV while considering the pause time of its RWP model. Furthermore, we propose two types of secrecy improvement strategies for the considered communication model. We strike a good trade-off between the secrecy improvement and transmit outage probability. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate our theoretical analysis.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There have been large developments in the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) industry over the last decade. Although UAV development was mainly for military related use in the beginning and despite there being fear surrounding the release of this technology to the open market for quite a long time, nowadays, there are a variety of applications where UAVs are used extensively, such as in agriculture, infrastructure inspection and monitoring, mobile retranslation relays for communications, etc. One of the weaknesses of electrically propelled UAVs is flight autonomy; there is often a difficult trade-of between the weight of the payload, batteries, and surface to be surveyed that is necessary to determine. There have been many attempts to use photovoltaic cells to increase the flight time for UAVs; however, a reliable solution has not yet been developed. The present paper presents improvements that have been conducted to extend the autonomy of electrically derived UAVs: instead of gluing photovoltaic cells on the wings, the new approach embeds the solar cells into the wing structure as well as develops a new wing that is significantly lighter to compensate for the weight added by the photovoltaic cells. It was demonstrated that by using this approach, a 33% increase in the flight time can be achieved with only one modified wing in a prototype vehicle. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the last decade, unmanned aerial systems have emerged in different fields, such as entertainment, military, Internet of Things, emergencies. In these systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate with each other based on a flying network to provide services to customers such as live streaming, high-speed access point, etc. The mobility of UAVs can bring numerous advantages in emergency cases, for example, rescuing and searching victims in areas where the network infrastructure is not available. However, the crucial task needed to be done first is to locate the victims' coordinates. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting the coordinates of subscribers with the Wi-Fi signals generated from victims' phones in the absence of network infrastructure of communication operators using a flying network for emergencies based on UAV-swarms. We develop a new protocol for communication between UAVs and UAV-swarms. A structure of UAV-swarms is considered to optimize the searching time.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones provide new capabilities for disaster response management (DRM). In a DRM scenario, multiple heterogeneous drones collaboratively work together forming a flying ad-hoc network (FANET) instantiated by a ground control station. However, FANET air-to-air and air-to-ground links that serve critical application expectations can be impacted by: (i) environmental obstacles, and (ii) limited battery capacities. In this paper, we present a novel obstacle-aware and energy-efficient multi-drone coordination and networking scheme that features a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based location prediction algorithm coupled with a packet forwarding algorithm for drone-to-ground network establishment. We specifically present two novel drone location-based solutions (i.e., heuristic greedy, and learning-based) in our packet forwarding approach to support heterogeneous drone operation as per application requirements. These requirements involve improving connectivity (i.e., optimize packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay) despite environmental obstacles, and improving efficiency (i.e., by lower energy use and time consumption) despite energy constraints. We evaluate our scheme by comparing it with state-of-the-art networking algorithms in a trace-based DRM FANET simulation testbed. Results show that our strategy overcomes obstacles and can achieve between 81-90% of network connectivity performance observed under no obstacle conditions. With obstacles, our scheme improves network connectivity performance by 14-38 % while also providing 23-54% of energy savings.  © 2021 IFIP.},

	abstract = {The tri-axial MEMS gyroscope in the magneto- inertial navigation system (MINS) of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) needs to be calibrated. To solve this problem, a cross calibration method is proposed, which is based on the relationship between the angular velocity and the time derivative of a vector to calibrate errors of gyroscope. The time derivative of a constant vector in the navigation coordination frame can be expressed by the cross product of the vector itself and the angular velocity of the aircraft-body coordinate frame. The cross calibration method is derived from the above principles, which can calibrate the tri-axial gyroscope efficiently without precision equipment. Numerical simulation results show that both the integral form and differential form of the cross product calibration method can effectively identify and compensate the error coefficients of gyroscope. And promising calibration results can be achieved under the influence of various factors. Experimental results on the gyroscope of the MINS module show that the accuracy of the proposed method can reach 0.2279°/s, which is close to the conventional method based on the rate table. The calibrated gyroscope data are combined with the second-order complementary filtering algorithm in the flight control of a rotor UAV. The angle deviation is controlled within 0.8° in the fixed-point hover state, which is conducive to the in-field calibration of UAV and the measurement of the attitude data in real flight. © 2020, Science Press.

This mechanism is a part of a larger project for detection and removal of potato plants infected by virus Y (PVY). An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped by hyperspectral camera and high precision GPS system, will fly over a potato field to locate a sick plant within a few centimeters and communicate the GPS coordinates to an AGV. This AGV will navigate to the target location and rogue (remove) the infected plant automatically. However, currently there is no roguing mechanism available off the shelf, which can be quickly attached to existing farm equipment to automate the process. Because of significant crop losses every year due to PVY, roguing in a timely manner is extremely important to the farming community. After multiple design iterations and simulations for the end-effector, a novel roguing mechanism was designed. Significant effort was also expended in assuring the designed mechanism can be easily connected to existing farm equipment. A 1/3rd scale prototype model was built for motion analysis. This prototype has been tested in a laboratory setting with promising results. Operational and design details of this mechanism have been successfully tested.

	abstract = {From the view of power marketization, a bi-level optimal locating and sizing model for a grid-side battery energy storage system (BESS) with coordinated planning and operation is proposed in this paper. Taking the conventional unit side, wind farm side, BESS side, and grid side as independent stakeholder operators (ISOs), the benefits of BESS are divided into direct and indirect parts. The direct revenue for BESS is the arbitrage of the peak-valley electricity price and auxiliary service compensation. The indirect revenue refers to the benefits that BESS provides to other ISOs, including wind curtailed energy savings, a reduction in the operating cost of units, and a decrease in network loss. To maximize the comprehensive benefits of BESS, the outer layer is a multi-objective optimal model for BESS locating and sizing based on a cost-benefit analysis. The inner layer is an optimal scheduling model that coordinates wind power, units, and BESS. Thus, a multi-objective bi-level model for the optimal configuration of BESS is established. In addition, by considering the impact of a charge/discharge strategy on the life cycle of BESS, the interaction between BESS planning and operation is introduced into the model based on the equivalent life loss. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on the information entropy method and the second-order cone relaxation method is employed to solve the optimal model. Results based on an improved IEEE 39-node system verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In modern and rapidly evolving society, as you drones are not only a means of entertainment but also a tool that we use in a variety of applications, such as precision farming, aerial photography and video, mapping, parcel transportations, search and rescue and in many other applications. In order for these applications to be successful, drones must constantly evolve, in terms of the autonomy of their flights, but also in the management of the energy they consume, in order to be able to travel long distances. Electric drones mostly use lithium polymer batteries (LiPo) for their power supply and their flight time depends on their battery capacity and is directly affected by its weight and ranges from 5 to 45 minutes with a full charge of its batteries. According to these time constraints the distances at which a drone can operate autonomously is narrow. In recent years, scientists, research teams and universities have developed drone charging systems that do not require human intervention. This paper presents a survey of drone charging stations that can be used in a variety of applications. The survey covers charging stations that use wired and wireless power transfer (WPT) methods, and compares their main elements and features.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Due to its high mobility, low cost, easy deployment, scalability, and intelligent characteristics, UAV has been widely used in the military and civil fields. However, considering that the endurance of UAV itself is limited to a certain extent, and the terrain of the affected area is often complex, and there is a lot of information to be collected, Therefore, reasonable path planning is the key to improving the efficiency of UAV data collection. By analyzing the above background, it leads to the significance of UAV path planning in emergency scenarios. Then, starting from the path planning of a single UAV, the classic algorithms of path planning of a single UAV are investigated, and the basic ideas and algorithm flow are analyzed. Thirdly, given the characteristics of the need to improve the efficiency of information retrieval in emergency scenarios, it is analyzed that compared with a single UAV, multi-UAV has higher search efficiency, better system stability, and is easier to realize in practical application. Ant colony algorithm is used to realize the cooperative search of multiple UAVs. In this part, the modeling process, design idea, search principle, and other details of the algorithm are introduced in detail, and its advantages are analyzed. After that, the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by simulation, and the advantages compared with other algorithms are compared. Finally, the shortcomings of the current algorithm and prospects are analyzed, and ideas for improvement are proposed.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Because of the autopilot and global positioning system, installed with the drone, the flight of the multi-functional drone is autonomously controllable from the ground control station. The long endurance drone is designed for uninterrupted flying of 30 minutes at an altitude of 300 meters. The high definition camera of the drone transmits live video stream of any projected area to the ground control station using the video transmitter. The drone automatically returns to the ground control station when its battery voltage reduces down to 21.6 volts or the communication with the ground control station is lost.

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an emerging technology that assists in various automated activities where human involvement is minimal. Though individual UAVs are extremely useful entities, their productivity can further be increased by deploying multi-UAVs. Pattern formation among multi-UAVs is one of the key functionalities in a swarm environment that is essential for several UAV missions namely military expedition, search and rescue operations, drone based delivery mechanisms etc. In this paper, to facilitate pattern formation among UAVs in an effective manner, a Time-Interleaved Pattern Formation (TIPF) Mechanism is proposed. The existing systems work for a fixed number of drones whose pattern switching mechanisms are preprogrammed. However, the TIPF mechanism enables switching patterns among dynamic number of drones (UAVs) on the fly by inducing a small delay between each UAV movement. The TIPF mechanism avoids collision, which occurs due to the simultaneous movement of UAVs. The proposed TIPF mechanism encompasses a Centralised Coordinate Calculation (CCC) algorithm to easily calculate the coordinates of UAVs in a given pattern. Further, this mechanism has also been simulated and tested in our proposed virtual IP based Software In The Loop (V-SITL) environment. This proposed V-SITL environment offers increased scalability on account of the entire UAV system being simulated in a single computer. The TIPF mechanism has been simulated for 8 drones in a dynamic manner for square and triangle patterns. The simulation results show that the pattern formation time avoids collision in a time interleaving rate of 52.63%. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The industrial investment in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is soaring due to their multiple autonomous applications, such as aerial photography, rescue operations, surveillance, and scientific data collection. Current sensing is critical for determining battery capacity in charging and discharging process and alerting for system fault during the flight. Shunt resistors and Hall-effect sensors are traditionally used in UAVs. Recently, magnetoresistive (MR) sensors are gaining enormous attention from researchers. MR sensors tend to consume less power, and they are smaller in size than the Hall-effect sensors. In this paper, a number of off-the-shelf MR sensors were investigated to evaluate the possibility of applying them for UAVs. Another type of magnetic sensor (fluxgate) and shunt resistor was also studied and compared as a reference. The relative scoring method is adopted to evaluate the sensor performance under different metrics, and the results disclose that the MR sensors are highly suitable for current sensing of UAVs due to their higher accuracy, lower energy consumption, wider temperature endurance, smaller size, and less weight than other magnetic current sensors. They are also very competitive with traditional shunt resistors through the overall comparison. The remanence, thermal stability, and cross-field sensitivity of MR sensors are further discussed. This finding provides insight into the selection strategy of current sensors for UAVs and can enhance the industrial development of UAV potentially. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

However, the UAV industry is faced with various bottlenecks, such as the low intelligence level of UAVs, the high technical threshold for completing complex tasks, the lack of autonomous cooperative ability between the formation of UAVs, and the lack of an intelligent operating system. To achieve the route planning and monitoring design of UAVs, we first designed a remote intelligent monitoring system for a UAV based on multimode communication and cloud computing, which consisted of an intelligent control module, a coordination module for the multimode communication and autonomous formation of UAVs, a UAV cloud operating system, and panoramic image dynamic fusion technology. Then, we presented an adaptive data transmission method based on priority in the multimode communication system. Finally, a route planning and monitoring design based on a global particle algorithm was designed for the remote intelligent monitoring system of the UAV. The simulation results show that the remote security system operates normally and meets urgent communication needs. At the same time, both data and video image transmission can be achieved, and the route of the UAV can be effectively planned. © 2021 M Y U Scientific Publishing Division. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system is considered in this paper. Different from most existing works that only consider the information transmission assisted by the UAV, in the studied model, the UAV can not only act as an information relay to help the mobile users (MUs) to offload their computation tasks to the MEC server, but also broadcast energy to MUs. This is significant in situations where the target area is experiencing communications and power outage due to an emergency such as an earthquake. The objective of the paper is to maximize the sum of the MU’s complete task-input bits by jointly optimizing the time allocation, the UAV’s energy transmit power, and the UAV’s trajectory under a given time duration. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which is non-convex and difficult to solve directly. To solve this problem, a block coordinate descending algorithm is proposed, which solves two sub-problems iteratively until convergence. Simulation results indicate that the trajectories of the UAV rely highly on the positions of the MUs and the MEC server, and the proposed algorithm has superior performance comparing with two benchmark algorithms under different conditions. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Advances in mobile robotics and autonomous systems are shaping our world, where robots are to replace humans in many aspects of life. The concern of our research group is to automate routine applications that require high precision and to be accomplished at cost-effective approaches. “Search and Find” is one such application that meets those criteria. In this project, we have developed, implemented, and tested the Advanced Search and Find System (ASAFS) which is an advanced search and find application where a group of heterogeneous robots perform a coordinated search mission over a given area. Heterogeneous robots are mobile robots made with divergent functions to fly, drive, or surf in 3-D real world. The challenge we have faced in developing such a system is how to integrate multiple mobile agents in a unified platform that plans, controls, and oversees the search and find assignment. The answer to this challenge points eventually to the use of IoT as a leading framework for interoperability and system integration. The Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experimental Testbed (MAUVET) is an IoT-based platform designed with many considerations to accommodate next-generation UAV applications development and deployment. MAUVET is an open-architecture platform with open communication standards and modular software core functions.

	abstract = {Purpose: Increasing endurance was a very appropriate subject for the biomimetic approach. The study aims to design and manufacture a long-lasting mini unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using active gliding and soaring. Design/methodology/approach: The endurance of mini UAVs is limited by battery or fuel capacity, and it is not always possible to increase these energy sources due to the fuselage size. Long endurance aircraft are required in various areas such as silent environment and traffic monitoring or search and rescue. Literature research on bird flight performance conducted to determine design parameters. These parameters are used in the theoretical design of the UAV for optimization. Computational fluid dynamics simulation and flight tests of the UAV performed to figure out the success of the design. Findings: For a mini UAV to be produced in this class, it has been observed that it is more accurate to examine birds instead of gliders due to the size similarity. The UAV design reaches a 27.5 L/D (Glide ratio) ratio in the theoretical approach. However, flight results approved max L/D ratio is around 25 at the sea level. This flight performance is enough to outperform in glide ratio of Wandering albatrosses. Practical implications: Sailplanes are known as sport aircraft. However, recent projects focus on glider designs due to fuel efficiency and silent tracking. Stemme S-14 that carries a high-resolution camera is one of the examples of these projects. The unmanned glider design can lead to these implications in the UAVs at least during the stand-by period in the air. Thanks to low weight, UAVs do not require strong thermals, which allows flying almost all over the world. Originality/value: Researchers generally focus on increasing the battery capacity or the performance of the UAV. However, this study’s concentration is to increase the flight duration of the UAV by using geographical currents. For this purpose, taking advantage of bird morphology is quite a new topic. Also, glider type designs are rarely found in the field. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, since the demand for this type of applications is sparsely distributed and comprises spatiotemporal uncertainty, prior to the deployment of aerial means, the dimension and configuration of multi-UAV systems has to be addressed. This paper proposes a clustering-based dimensioning strategy for networks of aerial vehicles, that incorporates heterogeneous vehicle characteristics and energy-related autonomy constraints to determine the type and number of vehicles required to meet a given demand. The approach follows a fuzzy data-driven method which enables generating coverage regions with elastic boundaries that allows for cooperation between neighboring regions to manage high and low demand scenarios, providing improved resilience to demand fluctuations and guaranteeing a well-conditioned formulation for the optimal resource allocation problem. © 2020 IEEE.},

Both satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be adopted to solve this problem in the 6G era. Towards this end, we consider a cognitive satellite-UAV network (CSUN), where satellite and UAVs are managed in a coordinated manner, and opportunistically share spectrum to alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem. Particularly, we use the UAV swarm to mitigate the satellite-UAV interference. Motivated by practical applications, the limited on-board energy and imperfectly acquired channel state information (CSI) are discussed. We propose a process-oriented optimization scheme to maximize the data transmission efficiency, which jointly optimizes the transmit power and hovering time of UAV swarm for the whole flight process. The scheme takes both energy constraints and interference power constraints into account, and performs in an iterative way. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, which could be an effective solution for extending the coverage performance of terrestrial 4G/5G networks.  © 2020 IEEE.},

VSG(Virtual Synchronous Generator) technology can effectively support the grid frequency, but there are few research results on virtual damping of VSG technology at present. In order to make more effective use of VSG virtual damping and further improve the stability of power system with high wind power permeability, the mathematical relationship between VSG controller parameters, virtual inertia and virtual damping is derived. In view of the contradiction between VSG virtual inertia and virtual damping regulation, a coordinated control strategy of VSG controller parameters combining online identification of dominant oscillation mode and particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by a two-area interconnected power system simulation model including doubly-fed wind farm. The simulative results show that the proposed control strategy can achieve comprehensive optimization of system frequency stability and power stability. © 2020, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

Such calculations require knowing the battery discharge profile. Simplified flight time calculation methods provide data with uncertainties as they are based solely on manufacturer datasheet information. This study presents a setup to measure the battery discharge curve using a LabVIEW interface with a low-cost acquisition system. The acquired data passes through a nonlinear optimisation algorithm to find the battery coefficients, which enables the more precise estimation of its range and endurance. The great advantage of this model is that it makes it possible to predict how the battery will discharge at different rates using just one experimental curve. The methodology was applied to three different batteries and the model was validated with different discharge rates in a controlled environment, which resulted in endurance lower than 3.0% for most conditions and voltage estimation error lower than 3.0% in operational voltage. The work also presented a methodology for estimating cruise time based on the current used during each flight stage. © 2020 Royal Aeronautical Society.},

	abstract = {Helleh River, a southern vital agricultural ecosystem in Iran, has been suffering from both water shortage and quality degradation in recent decades. To deal with the problems, different stakeholders have been suggesting the central government some compartment development plans including construction of dams and irrigation districts, installation of modern irrigation technologies, and modification of crop patterns and irrigation–leaching strategies. Accordingly, this paper proposes a generic novel hydro-economic methodology for basin-scale optimal planning of an integrated development scheme for Helleh River Basin. Mentioned measures in different spatial scales from farm-level to basin-level as well as distinct time horizons of short-term and long-term are holistically evaluated and optimized based on technical, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic aspects. In this regard, a water allocation simulation model, i.e. WEAP software, improved here by some extra modules for salt routing and economic evaluation in Python Programming Environment is coupled with an optimization algorithm, i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization, which results in a new holistic hydro-economic simulation–optimization tool. Results demonstrate the economic efficiency of constructing three new dams, improvement and development of 19930 ha (ha) of irrigation area, irrigation technology, and strategy change, and crop pattern modification. Furthermore, results show that optimizing irrigation–leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of the economic value of water compared to the status quo, while construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in the economic value of water due to increase in both costs and leaching-related water usage. We discuss how irrigation technology improvement in salinity-affected basin may lead to a decrease in the economic value of water. Moreover, we advocate for the application of deficit irrigation strategy while respecting salt leaching requirements and cultivation of lower water-consuming crops. Results demonstrate how reservoirs’ operation takes a minor role in the regulation of rivers’ salinity, while we anticipate a significant increase in salt concentration of crops’ root zones due to more efficient water use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

With the popularization of smart devices, the demand for multimedia services is increasing in disaster relief. Therefore, it is very important to significantly improve throughput of unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) while ensuring quality-of-service (QoS) of multimedia traffic. In this paper, we consider a UAV-BS to serve a group of users in the downlink who have different statistical delay-bound QoS requirements in an emergency situation. We formulate a problem to maximize the sum statistical-QoS-guaranteed throughput (effective capacity) of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D location, power and bandwidth allocation under each user's statistical QoS requirement constraint. The formulated problem is a non-linear non-convex optimization problem, which is very difficult to solve. To this end, we propose an efficient iteration algorithm based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques to solve it. Specifically, we decouple the primary problem into three sub-problems, which can be approximated as easy-to-solve convex optimization problems. In each iteration, three sub-problems are alternately optimized. Finally, numerical simulation results prove the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared with benchmarks.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial relays have found many applications in the current communication network. Since the air-to-ground (AtG) link differs from the terrestrial link, ensuring a reliable AtG transmission remains to be a meaningful issue. This article investigates that a UAV works as an aerial relay to forward information from multiple access points to multiple remote base stations in an emergency situation. Using the full-duplex decode-and-forward relaying mode, we formulate a problem to minimize the maximum outage probability among all links, jointly optimizing the UAV altitude, power control, and bandwidth allocation. The outage probability function takes into account the line-of-sight probability-based AtG fading and the self-interference introduced by full-duplex relaying, both of which make our formulated problem nonconvex. We reformulate the outage probability function into a more tractable function. Then, we decouple the original problem into two subproblems, that is, altitude optimization as well as power control and bandwidth allocation. Each subproblem is solved by the successive convex optimization technique, and an overall iteration algorithm is proposed to solve the original problem based on the block coordinate descent theory. Simulation results reveal the reliability gain of our proposed algorithm compared with our designed benchmark. Besides, the optimal UAV three-dimensional location that minimizes the global min-max outage probability is found by numerical simulations. Finally, the average throughput gain can also be obtained by our proposed algorithm. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Smart healthcare has been applied in many fields such as disease surveillance and telemedicine, etc. However, there are some challenges for device deployment, data collection and guarantee of stainability in regional disease surveillance. First, it is difficult to deploy sensors and adjust the sensor network in unknown region for dynamic disease surveillance. Second, the limited life-cycle of sensor network may cause the loss of surveillance data. Thus, it is important to provide a sustainable and robust regional disease surveillance system. Given a set of Disease surveillance Area (DsA)s and Point of disease Surveillance (PoS)s, some sensors are deployed to monitor these PoSs, and a drone collect data from the sensors as well as charge the sensors to extend their life-cycles. The drone replenish its energy by relying on the bus network. We first formulate the drone assisted regional disease surveillance problem under the constraints of life-cycle of sensors and energy of drone, and propose an approximation algorithm to find a feasible cycle of drone to minimize the traveling time cost of drone. To satisfy the diversity requirements and dynamic scalability of regional disease surveillance, we deploy one robot in each DsA instead of sensors. We further formulate the learning transferable driven regional disease surveillance problem, and propose a joint schedule algorithm of drone and robots. The results of both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the total time cost by 39.71 and 48.74 percent, average waiting time by 42.00 and 50.14 percent, and increase the average accessing ratio of PoSs by 15.53 and 22.30 percent, through the assistance of bus network and learning transferable features. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

Unfortunately, when natural disasters occur, the communication system and infrastructure of a city may be partially or even completely destroyed. In this case, communication becomes a crucial part of search-and-rescue missions. This study develops an aerial communication relay platform as an effective solution for communication loss during a natural disaster. The model used considers the aircraft altitude and attitude, which affect the energy acquisition and consumption, and the signal fading effects. The flight path is planned by adopting a nonlinear optimization technique, i.e., the Hermite-Simpson collocation method. For a realistic communication model regarding urban signal loss and path propagation, the building deployment of an area of radius 2km in two cities in South Korea (Seoul and Jeonju) was obtained. Simulation experiments for the different urban environments were performed to test the communication reliability, focusing on the relation between the unmanned aerial vehicle and ground users. Through the simulation, the optimal flight paths in high-rise urban and urban microcell environment were obtained. The obtained results were later compared with a baseline simulation composed of a steady-flight circular path. The generated flight path proves the feasibility of endurance flights for low-altitude communication aid aircrafts using a unified model for signal fading alongside solar power energy acquisition into the case study.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work investigates a combined internal combustion engine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) hybrid powertrain for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are increasingly used in large agriculture for crop management and water resource visual inspection, and in militarized applications, as they allow for safer, unmanned reconnaissance missions. The limited flight time of UAVs, as a result of the traditional lithium polymer batteries used for power, has restricted the widespread implementation of the UAV technology. A hybrid power train, utilizing energy dense liquid fuel, provides the capability of powering a UAV for longer duration missions. The hybrid power train consists of a small internal combustion engine that acts as a partial oxidation fuel reformer, simultaneously producing mechanical shaft power. The 0.3 in3 piston engine is a typical air cooled, glow engine utilizing a 60/40 percent (by volume) mixture of methanol and nitromethane, respectively. The syngas generated by the combustion engine can then be utilized by a tubular SOFC stack to generate electrical energy for the UAV flight systems. The SOFC system operating on combustion exhaust from the engine produced a maximum of ~650 mW/cm2, while the engine was continually producing ~750 W of mechanical shaft power. In case of an engine failure, the liquid fuel may be directly utilized by the SOFC system to maintain power generation. Additionally, the engine may be manually shutdown to provide silent onboard power generation. In testing, a tubular SOFC provided with direct liquid 60/40 methanol/nitromethane fuel was capable of producing above 550 mW/cm2 for maximum power. The SOFC system was able to operate continuously under direct liquid fueling for 4 hours without degradation. Additional experimentation was performed to discern the nature of the combustion process as it leaves the SOFC, and to provide scientific backing to the exceptional performance of the 60/40 methanol/nitromethane fuel mixture. By method of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the combustion products exiting the SOFC were collected and analyzed with the goal of proving the 60/40 mixture is the ideal fuel source for this application. The power produced by the proposed hybrid powertrain is expected to be sufficient to power a up to a 25 kg gross takeoff weight UAV for long endurance missions lasting in the range of 200-500 % of current battery powered UAV flight duration. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

	abstract = {For the rising hazard of pirate attacks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm monitoring is a promising countermeasure. Previous monitoring methods have deficiencies in either adaptivity to dynamic events or simple but effective path coordination mechanisms, and they are inapplicable to the large-area, low-target-density, and long-duration persistent counter-piracy monitoring. This article proposes a self-organized UAV swarm counter-piracy monitoring method. Based on the pheromone map, this method is characterized by (1) a reservation mechanism for anticipatory path coordination and (2) a ship-adaptive mechanism for adapting to merchant ship distributions. A heuristic depth-first branch and bound search algorithm is designed for solving individual path planning. Simulation experiments are conducted to study the optimal number of plan steps and adaptivity scaling factor for different numbers of UAVs. Results show that merely decreasing revisit intervals cannot effectively reduce pirate attacks. Without the ship-adaptive mechanism, the proposed method reduces up to 87.2%, 43.2%, and 5.5% of revisit intervals compared to the Lèvy Walk method, the sweep method, and the baseline self-organized method, respectively, but cannot reduce pirate attacks; while with the ship-adaptive mechanism, the proposed method can reduce pirate attacks by up to 6.7% compared to the best of the baseline methods.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Low altitude Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) provide a highly exible and capable platform for remote sensing and autonomous control. There are many applications that would benefit from an additional bird's eye view, including mapping, environmental reconnaissance, and search and rescue to name a few. An autonomous (or partially autonomous) drone could assist in several of these scenarios, freeing the operator to focus on higher-level strategic planning. While numerous commercial drones exist on the market, none truly provide a exible foundation for vision guided autonomy research. Herein, we propose the design of a physical UAS platform, called VADER (Visually Aware Drone for Environmental Reconnaissance), and an accompanying simulation environment that addresses many of these tasks. In particular, we show how Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and open source software can now be combined to realize powerful end-to-end UAS research solutions. The beauty of unifying these factors is accelerated prototyping and minimal time to migrate and test in the real world.

	abstract = {Purpose: When comparing and contrasting different types of fixed-wing military aircraft on the basis of an energetic efficiency figure-of-merit, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) dedicated to tactical medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) operations appear to have significant potential when hybrid-electric propulsion and power systems (HEPPS) are implemented. Beginning with a baseline Eulair drone, this paper aims to examine the feasibility of retro-fitting with an Autarkic-Parallel-HEPPS architecture to enhance performance of the original single diesel engine. Design/methodology/approach: In view of the low gravimetric specific energy performance attributes of batteries in the foreseeable future, the best approach was found to be one in which the Parallel-HEPPS architecture has the thermal engine augmented by an organic rankine cycle (ORC). For this study, with the outer mould lines fixed, the goal was to increase endurance without increasing the Eulair drone maximum take-off weight beyond an upper limit of +10%. The intent was to also retain take-off distance and climb performance or, where possible, improve upon these aspects. Therefore, as the focus of the work was on power scheduling, two primary control variables were identified as degree-of-hybridisation for useful power and cut-off altitude during the en route climb phase. Quasi-static methods were used for technical sub-space modelling, and these modules were linked into a constrained optimisation algorithm. Findings: Results showed that an Autarkic-Parallel-HEPPS architecture comprising an ORC thermal energy recovery apparatus and high-end year-2020 battery, the endurance of the considered aircraft could be increased by 11%, i.e. a total of around 28 h, including de-icing system, in-flight recharge and emergency aircraft recovery capabilities. The same aircraft with the de-icing functionality removed resulted in a 20% increase in maximum endurance to 30 h. Practical implications: Although the adoption of Series/Parallel-HEPPS only solutions do tend to generate questionable improvements in UAV operational performance, combinations of HEPPS with energy recovery machines that use, for example, an ORC, were found to have merit. Furthermore, such architectural solutions could also offer opportunity to facilitate additional functions like de-icing and emergency aircraft recovery during engine failure, which is either not available for UAVs today or prove to be prohibitive in terms of operational performance attributes when implemented using a conventional PPS approach. Originality/value: This technical paper highlights a new degree of freedom in terms of power scheduling during climbing transversal flight operations. A control parameter of cut-off altitude for all types of HEPPS-based aircraft should be introduced into the technical decision-making/optimisation/analysis scheme and is seen to be a fundamental aspect when conducting trade-studies with respect to degree-of-hybridisation for useful power. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The root mean square error between the predicted coordinates and the actual coordinates of the location node is selected to construct the fitness function. With the help of MATLAB software, the simulation comparison between the QPSO-GRNN localization algorithm and the non-optimized GRNN localization algorithm is established. The experimental results show that the average error of the non-optimized GRNN localization algorithm is 1. 0143m, and the average error of the QPSO-GRNN localization algorithm is 0. 5683m.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of a large number of small low-cost devices, has become a leading solution for smart cities, smart agriculture, smart buildings, smart grids, e-healthcare, etc. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with IoT can result in an airborne UAV-based IoT (UIoT) system and facilitate various value-added services from sky to ground. In addition to wireless sensors, various kinds of IoT devices are connected in UIoT, making the network more heterogeneous. In a UIoT system, for achieving high throughput in an energy-efficient manner, it is crucial to design an efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol because the MAC layer is responsible for coordinating access among the IoT devices in the shared wireless medium. Thus, various MAC protocols with different objectives have been reported for UIoT. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no survey had been performed so far that dedicatedly covers MAC protocols for UIoT. Hence, in this study, state-of-the-art MAC protocols for UIoT are investigated. First, the communication architecture and important design considerations of MAC protocols for UIoT are examined. Subsequently, different MAC protocols for UIoT are classified, reviewed, and discussed with regard to the main ideas, innovative features, advantages, limitations, application domains, and potential future improvements. The reviewed MAC protocols are qualitatively compared with regard to various operational characteristics and system parameters. Additionally, important open research issues and challenges with recommended solutions are summarized and discussed. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

With the use of drone platforms as means of package delivery or search and rescue in dangerous sites, full autonomy is now attracting the robotic community. Specifically, using drones in urban areas requires some degrees of autonomy because of potential dynamic obstacles. This paper provides an architecture inspired by natural livings such as insects to mitigate the navigation challenge autonomously. We conduct our study in a standard simulation environment, and results will be compared to a human expert. Using deep reinforcement learning, we manage to generalize the learned policy in this specific domain. Finally, our simulated results imply that reasonable collision avoidance in urban environments is achieved compared to a human pilot.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones have been used for many applications. In certain applications like surveillance and emergency rescue operations, multiple drones work as a network to achieve the target in which any one of the drones will act as the master or coordinator to communicate, monitor, and control other drones. Hence, drones are energy-constrained; there is a need for effective coordination among them in terms of decision making and communication between drones and base stations during these critical situations. This paper focuses on providing an efficient approach for the election of the cluster head dynamically, which heads the other drones in the network. The main objective of the paper is to provide an effective solution to elect the cluster head among multi drones at different periods based on the various physical constraints of drones. The elected cluster head acts as the decision-maker and assigns tasks to other drones. In a case where the cluster head fails, then the next eligible drone is re-elected as the leader. Hence, an optimally distributed solution proposed is called Bio-Inspired Optimized Leader Election for Multiple Drones (BOLD), which is based on two AI-based optimization techniques. The simulation results of BOLD compared with the existing Particle Swarm Optimization-Cluster head election (PSO-C) in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption, and from the results, it has been proven that the lifetime of drones with the BOLD algorithm is 15% higher than the drones with PSO-C algorithm. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Swarms of robots are starting to appear in aerial and ground robotics across multiple operational domains: be it for search-and-rescue mapping, or Olympic light shows, controlled groups of drones are able to be coordinated in groups. This capability does not currently extend to the underwater domain, for a reason of basic physics: the attenuation of light in water is 10 orders of magnitude greater than that in air, rendering ineffective the navigation and communication technologies used in terrestrial robotics. Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation is either expensive or unwieldy, requiring high-power sensors such as inertial navigation sensors (INS) that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, frequent surfacing for GPS, or the deployment of geo-located acoustic beacons, limiting the operational area which is a severe constraint given the scale of oceanographic sensing. To do swarms of underwater vehicles will require a navigation and communication scheme that allows vehicles to remain together in an area while prosecuting a mission without these constraints. This paper suggests a system that would make underwater swarming possible by using single-transducer, Doppler-based and multi-frequency attenuation-based acoustic navigation without time-synchronization for multi-vehicle swarming. In this solution, a leader with good navigation carries a multi-frequency sound source. Scalable numbers of followers equipped with a custom low-cost acoustic package then adapt heading based on Doppler-shifted frequency and range using multi-frequency difference in absorption. In this paper, the theory behind this technique is presented and tested under different simulation conditions. Design of a prototype low-cost system is also described. © 2016 IEEE.},

Maximizing the energy efficiency of this UAV infrastructure is important. Motivated by this, we propose joint resource allocation and UAV scheduling with GRS sleeping (GRSS). Further, we propose the use of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) with joint transmission (JT) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) along with GRSS to increase the coverage and data rates, respectively. Through exhaustive simulation results, we show that the proposed CoMP along with GRSS results in up to 10% higher energy savings and 24% increase in coverage. Further, NOMA along with GRSS results in up to 9% enhancement in throughput of the system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In order to mitigate this limitation, the GEOSAR concept (Geosynchronous Synthetic Aperture Radar) aims to provide almost permanent illumination over wide areas of the planet. This work is performed in the context of an on-going GEOSAR mission: Hydroterra will help scientists unravel the details of the daily water cycle. The Advanced Radar Geosynchronous Observation System (ARGOS) is an upgrade in order to enhance its performance. It consists of a multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system hosted on a swarm of minisatellites in quasi-geostationary orbits. The real aperture would be achievable in about 40 minutes, enabling applications so far unseen, such as monitoring fast deformations, landslides, and other applications for emergency and security. GEOSAR missions require unprecedented orbit determination precision (metric scale using autofocus techniques) in order to form properly focused images. In previous works, interferometry has been experimentally validated as a feasible orbit determination technique with the successful tracking of the DVB-S TV broadcasting signals from a single satellite of the non-cooperative ASTRA 19.2ºE geosynchronous constellation. The large processing gain of the interferometer allows the system to make use of low gain antennas. Thus, the pointing of the ground receivers is equally valid for all the satellites of the same constellation. In order to simulate the ARGOS configuration, this work explores the simultaneous orbital tracking of three satellites (ASTRA 1L, ASTRA 1M and ASTRA 1N) by means of a time domain multiplexing approach. The slow evolution of a geosynchronous spacecraft trajectory with respect to Earth allows the system to tune one satellite at a time in intervals of some minutes without losing track of any of them. Therefore, a single interferometer with fixed pointing is capable of precisely tracking different satellites of the same geosynchronous constellation simultaneously. The entire team is supervised by a professor whose original idea started the project. It consists of two PhD students who coordinate the main differentiated areas: hardware development, signal processing and orbit determination. Three undergraduate students work on the design and testing of the hardware modules which acquire the orbit observables. A graduate student and two undergraduates are responsible of the orbital model development, system simulations and orbit retrieval from experimental data.

	abstract = {In recent years, we have seen an uptrend in the popularity of UAVs driven by the desire to apply these aircraft to areas such as precision farming, infrastructure and environment monitoring, surveillance, surveying and mapping, search and rescue missions, weather forecasting, and more. The traditional approach for small size UAVs is to capture data on the aircraft, stream it to the ground through a high power data-link, process it remotely (potentially off-line), perform analysis, and then relay commands back to the aircraft as needed. Given the finite energy resources found onboard an aircraft (battery or fuel), traditional designs greatly limit aircraft endurance since significant power is required for propulsion, actuation, and the continuous transmission of visual data. All the mentioned application scenarios would benefit by carrying a high performance embedded computer system to minimize the need for data transmission. A major technical hurdle to overcome is that of drastically reducing the overall power consumption of these UAVs so they can be powered by solar arrays, and for long periods of time. This paper describes an integrated power model for a solar-powered, computationally-intensive unmanned aircraft that includes power models for solar generation, aircraft propulsion, and avionics. These power consumption and generation models are described, derived, and integrated into a cohesive system-wide aircraft power model that is presented in the form of a systemic flow diagram. Power balance expressions are also imposed based on temporal and physical constraints. Compared to works in the existing literature, the integrated model presented follows a holistic approach for UAV modeling that encompasses aircraft, propulsion, and solar models under realistic assumptions. Additionally, in order to enable high fidelity estimation while requiring minimal computation power, the model was developed to estimate the power consumption and generation based on flight path state, without needing precise aerodynamic measurements, e.g. angle-of-attack. Several of the methods have already been evaluated by means of ground and flight testing, as well as simulation, and showed errors ranging from negligible to approximately 5%. The motivation behind this work is the development of computationally-intensive, long-endurance solar-powered unmanned aircraft, the UIUC Solar Flyer, which will have continuous daylight ability to acquire and process high resolution visible and infrared imagery. Therefore, having a holistic integrated power model that can encompass power generation and consumption allows further aircraft and mission design and optimization can be performed.  © 2020 AIAA.},

	abstract = {With the widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology in military, civilian, and other fields, the demand for high-precision, low-power intelligent UAV tracking systems is also increasing. Aiming at the problems of scale variation, out-of-view, and occlusion in UAV tracking tasks, a real-time tracking algorithm for UAV based on light-weight Siamese network was proposed. Firstly, the lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNetV2, which is easy to be deployed in embedded devices, is selected as the feature extraction backbone network. Secondly, the channel spatial coordination attention module is designed to enhance the adaptive and discriminative ability of the model. Thirdly, the region proposal network is equipped, and the foreground background classification and boundary box regression response map are obtained through correlation. Finally, the weighted fusion multilayer response map is calculated and proposal region screening strategy is adjusted to obtain more accurate tracking results. Simulation experimental results on the UAV tracking dataset show that the tracking accuracy is improved by 3.5% compared to the current mainstream algorithm SiamRPN, and the algorithm can better cope with complex and changeable scenes. Meanwhile, on the NIVIDA RTX 2060 GPU, the tracking speed achieves 60 frame/s. © 2020, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Off-grid electrification of remote communities using sustainable energy systems (SESs) is a requisite for realizing sustainable development goals. Nonetheless, the capacity planning of the SESs is challenging as it needs to fulfil the fluctuating demand from a long-term perspective, in addition to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources (RESs). Owing to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the capacity planning problem, an efficient technique must be employed to achieve a cost-effective system. Existing techniques are, subject to some constraints on the derivability and continuity of the objective function, prone to premature convergence, computationally demanding, follows rigorous procedures to fine-tune the algorithm parameters in different applications, and often do not offer a fair balance during the exploitation and exploration phase of the optimization process. Furthermore, the literature review indicates that researchers often do not implement and examine the energy management scheme (EMS) of a microgrid while computing for the capacity planning problem of microgrids. This paper proposes a rule-based EMS (REMS) optimized by a nature-inspired grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) for long-term capacity planning of a grid-independent microgrid incorporating a wind turbine, a photovoltaic, a battery (BT) bank and a diesel generator (Dgen). In which, a rule-based algorithm is used to implement an EMS to prioritize the usage of RES and coordinate the power flow of the proposed microgrid components. Subsequently, an attempt is made to explore and confirm the efficiency of the proposed REMS incorporated with GOA. The ultimate goal of the objective function is to minimize the cost of energy (COE) and the deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP). The performance of the REMS is examined via a long-term simulation study to ascertain the REMS resiliency and to ensure the operating limit of the BT storage is not violated. The result of the GOA is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). The simulation results indicate that the proposed technique's superiority is confirmed in terms of convergence to the optimal solution. The simulation results confirm that the proposed REMS has contributed to better adoption of a cleaner energy production system, as the scheme significantly reduces fuel consumption, CO2 emission and COE by 92.4%, 92.3% and 79.8%, respectively as compared to the conventional Dgen. The comparative evaluation of the algorithms shows that REMS-GOA yields a better result as it offers the least COE (objective function), at $0.3656/kW h, as compared to the REMS-CSA at $0.3662/kW h and REMS-PSO at $0.3674/kW h, for the desired DPSP of 0%. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to highlight the effect of uncertainties on the system inputs that may arise in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) represent a significant aid on scenarios where fixed, ground infrastructures are temporarily or permanently not available; this is the case of large-scale applications of the Internet of Things (IoTs), e.g. smart city and agriculture 3.0, where the UAVs can be employed as mobile data mules and gather the data from Wireless Ground Sensors (WGSs). UAV-aided wireless sensor networks (WSNs) introduce considerable advantages both in terms of performance and costs since they avoid the need of error-prone multi-hop communications, and also the installation of static gateways; at the same time, they pose formidable research challenges for their implementation, like the synchronization issue between the UAV and the WGS and the path planning, which should take into account the extremely limited flight autonomy of the UAVs. In this paper, we address both the issues above by proposing BEE-DRONES, a novel framework for large-scale, ultra low-power UAV-aided WSNs. In order to mitigate the synchronization problem, we investigate the utilization of passive Wake-up Radio (WR) technology on the WGSs, and of wireless power transfer from the UAVs: by harvesting the energy from the UAV hovering over it, the WGS is activated only for the short time required to transfer the data toward the mobile sink, while it experiences zero-consumption in sleep mode. We investigate the performance of passive WR-based WGS through real measurements, under different WGS-UAV distances and antenna orientations. Then, based on such results, we formulate the joint WGS scheduling and UAV path planning problem, where the goal is to determine the optimal trajectory of the UAVs activating the WR-based WGSs while taking into account the Value of the Sensing (VoS) as well as the total lifetime of the WSN. The original problem is transformed into a multi-commodity flow problem, and both centralized and distributed heuristics over the multi-graph are proposed. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms through extensive OMNeT++ simulations; the results demonstrate the gain of BEE-DRONES in terms of extended lifetime compared to traditional, non WR-based solutions (e.g. duty-cycle), and in terms of reduced data-correlation compared to non VoS-aware path planning solutions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

However, situations where there is excessive aggregation and small amount of dispersion of the unmanned aerial vehicle cluster may occur when the network is formed. To mitigate these, a solution based on a 3D virtual force driven by self-adaptive deployment (named as 3DVFSD) is proposed. As a result, the three virtual forces of central gravity, uniform force, and boundary constraint force are combined to act on each node of the communication network. By coordinating the distance between the nodes, especially the threshold of the distance between the boundary node and the boundary, the centralized nodes can be relatively dispersed. Meanwhile, the nodes can be prevented from being too scattered by constraining the distance from the boundary node to the end. The simulation results show that the 3DVFSD algorithm is superior to the traditional virtual force-driven deployment strategy in terms of convergence speed, coverage, and uniformity. © The Author(s) 2021.},

The MR-LEACH identifies partitions in the network into multi-hop network paths. The multi-hop network paths allow all robots to exchange information without unnecessarily restricting the swarm’s range explicitly. As a result, the QRDPSO with MR-LEACH shows seamless inter-connectivity among the robots, lowering power consumption and increasing robots’ lifetime.

	abstract = {For long, we have studied tiny energy harvesters to liberate sensors from batteries. With remarkable progress in embedded deep learning, we are now re-imagining these sensors as intelligent compute nodes. Naturally, we are approaching a crossroad where sensor intelligence is meeting energy autonomy enabling maintenance-free swarm intelligence and unleashing a plethora of applications ranging from precision agriculture to ubiquitous asset tracking to infrastructure monitoring. One of the critical challenges, however, is to adapt intelligence fidelity in response to available energy to maximise the overall system availability. To this end, we present the design and implementation of ePerceptive: a novel framework for best-effort embedded intelligence, i.e., inference fidelity varies in proportion to the instantaneous energy supplied. ePerceptive operates on two core principles. First, it enables training a single deep neural network (DNN) to operate on multiple input resolutions without compromising accuracy or incurring memory overhead. Second, it modifies a DNN architecture by injecting multiple exits to guarantee valid, albeit lower-fidelity inferences in the event of energy interruption. The combination of these techniques offers a smooth adaptation between inference latency and recognition accuracy while matching the computational load to the available power budget. We report the manifestation of ePerceptive in designing batteryless cameras and microphones built with TI MSP430 MCU and off-the-shelf RF and solar energy harvesters. Our evaluation of these batteryless sensors with multiple vision and acoustic workloads suggest that the dynamic adaptation of ePerceptive can increase the inference throughput by up to 80% compared to a static baseline while ensuring a maximum accuracy drop of less than 6%. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {The movable supply platform of agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can change the landing site of midway supplying according to the variation of the UAVs location. It was mainly focused on the autonomous landing of agricultural UAVs on movable supply platform. The main novelty was that a piecewise control algorithm which combined the fuzzy logic control and PID control was proposed to control the landing process. When the distance error between the agricultural UAV and the movable supply platform was larger than the preset threshold, the fuzzy logic control was used to control the landing process due to its quick response character. When the distance error was smaller than the preset threshold, the PID control was used due to its high precision character. The detailed control process was as follows, firstly, in order to increase the recognition accuracy of UAV on movable platform, the upper part of the movable platform was designed to be a structure symmetry "H" pattern and the lower part was designed to be a contrasting QR code pattern. The UAV could use the optical flow algorithm to detect the black and white points, such that the relative speed between UAV and the platform could be calculated. Secondly, the dynamic model of UAV was constructed and then transformed its coordinates to the global coordinates to calculate the position error between agricultural UAV and the platform. Thirdly, the particle filter tracking algorithm and fitting function was used to fit the movement path of the UAV. At last, the proposed control method was used to control the UAV move along the fitted path. Using correlation coefficient index the Matlab simulation results proved the superiority of the proposed control method in tracking step signal and sinusoidal signal compared with individual fuzzy control method and PID control method. Furthermore, field test proved the control method could reduce the tracking error between UAV and movable supply platform to no more than 6.7 cm and the landing accuracy on movable supply to no more than 7.2 cm. © 2020, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantages of flexible take-off/landing sites, easy storage, and low manufacturing cost. They have been applied in many fields such as mapping, disaster assessment, and traffic monitoring. However, it is difficult to balance positioning accuracy, endurance, imaging chip selection, and cost when developing micro-UAVs. Therefore, low-cost UAVs need higher efficiency and imaging precision. This paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost fixed-wing UAV, covering both the hardware and the software. The system uses BeiDou/GPS integrated positioning to increase the numbers of visible satellites of Global Navigation Satellite System used in positioning and navigating and to reduce the positioning error caused by altitude angle changes; two motion cameras are used for simultaneous shooting as the imaging load. The system is inexpensive. According to the estimation of the test voyage time and the remaining battery power after two flight tests in Shanghai City, the UAV platform operation flight time was about 90 min and the operation voyage was about 70 km. © 2020 M Y U Scientific Publishing Division.

	abstract = {The characteristic pillars of a city are its economy, its mobility, its environment, its inhabitants, its way of life, and its organization. Since 1980, the concept of smart city generally consists of optimizing costs, organization, and the well-being of inhabitants. The idea is to develop means and solutions capable of meeting the needs of the population, while preserving resources and the environment. Owing to their little size, their flexibility, and their low cost, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are today used in a huge number of daily life applications. UAV use cases can be classified into three categories: data covering (like surveillance and event covering), data relaying (like delivery and emergency services), and data dissemination (like cartography and precise agriculture). In addition, the interest to Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) has risen in these recent years, especially in the context of smart cities. In such systems, both drivers and traffic managers share the information and cooperate to coordinate their actions to ensure safety, traffic efficiency, and environment preservation. In this work, we aimed at introducing a UAV in a use case that is likely to happen in C-ITS. A conflict is considered involving a car and a pedestrian. A UAV observes from the top of the scene and will play the role of the situation controller, the information collector, and the assignment of the instructions to the car driver in case of a harmful situation to avoid car-pedestrian collision. To this end, we highlight interactions between the UAV and the car vehicle (U2V communication), as well as between the UAV and infrastructure (U2I communication). Hence, the benefit of using UAV is emphasized to reduce accident gravity rate, braking distance, energy consumption, and occasional visibility reduction. © 2020 by the authors.

Most of the studies on UAV-served communication assumed that the users are located at outdoor and their position are coordinated as two-dimensional. However, most user traffic occurs indoors and a communication error is caused by a low throughput may cause casualties in indoor emergency. Recent studies that handle indoor disaster situation, only considered the UAV coverage. Therefore, practical research is needed for user's safety. In this paper, we propose uplink non-orthogonal multiple access for based full-duplex UAV increasing throughput in indoor disaster situation. We consider and modify indoor-to-outdoor path loss model for indoor users served by outdoor UAV, and the altitude of UAV ensuring signal to interference plus noise ratio.

The uncertain factors of wind power generation and load will increase the difficulty of dispatching. The fuzzy theory will be used to realize the fuzzy modelling of the coordinated connection of wind power and electric vehicles. The satisfaction index will be used to transform the multi-objective problems of deterministic environment and economy into single For the objective optimization problem, based on the improvement of the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm using linear descent search ideas and the particle information sharing method considering boundary constraints, the improved PSO algorithm is used to solve the proposed dynamic environment and economic dispatch model. From the grid operation and vehicle owners from the perspective of demand, the constraints of the system's rotation reserve and the daily travel of the owner are considered. The comparison and analysis of the simulation of algorithms and calculation examples and multiple scheduling schemes in different scenarios verify the rationality of the model and the superiority of the improved PSO algorithm for solving such dynamic scheduling problems.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has asserted that risks in deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within disaster response must be reduced by careful development of best-practice standards before implementing such systems. With recent humanitarian field tests of cargo UAVs as indication that implementation may soon become reality, a priori assessment of a smart-navigated (autonomous) UAV disaster cargo fleet via simulation modeling and analysis is vital to the best-practice development process. Logistical problems with ground transport of relief supplies in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (2017) pose a compelling use scenario for UAV disaster cargo delivery. In this context, we introduce a General Purpose Assessment Model (GPAM) that can estimate the potential effectiveness of a cargo UAV fleet for any given response region. We evaluate this model using the following standards: (i) realistic specifications; (ii) stable output for various realistic specifications; and (iii) support of humanitarian goals. To this end, we discuss data from humanitarian cargo delivery field tests and feedback from practitioners, perform sensitivity analyses, and demonstrate the advantage of using humanitarian rather than geographic distance in making fleet delivery assignments. We conclude with several major challenges faced by those who wish to implement smart-navigated UAV cargo fleets in disaster response, and the need for further GPAM development. This paper proposes the GPAM as a useful simulation tool to encourage and guide steps toward humanitarian use of UAVs for cargo delivery. The model’s flexibility can allow organizations to quickly and effectively determine how best to respond to disasters. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Simulation is performed to investigate the performance of each algorithm with respect to comparing their execution time, total distance travelled and number of turns made to reach the source to target. Further, experimental flight trails are made to examine the performance of these algorithms using a UAV.

The deployment delay of the UAVs greatly affects the rescue efficiency. Meanwhile, due to limited number of the UAVs, each UAV should spare it effort to serve the ground users. In the aim of solving above problems, we have designed a method for deploying UAVs. In this paper, we study how to minimize the number and deployment delay of UAVs, which is divided into three steps to solve the problem of UAVs' deployment. First, a K-Means algorithm (UB-K-Means) based on users' bandwidth requirements is proposed to cluster the ground users and determine the two-dimensional coordinates of UAVs. With such cluster algorithm, the UAVs' number can be decreased. In addition, we considered the bandwidth carried by the UAV. Then, the UAV's transmit power, the channel gain of per unit distance, the threshold of SNR, the ground user's noise power, and the UAV's coverage radius is used to determine the UAV's altitude. Finally, the UAVs are deployed to the specified location with the goal of minimizing deployment delays. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a small number of UAVs and a low deployment delay. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In a power system with renewable energy sources, the Low-Frequency Oscillatory (LFO) modes arise due to the intermittent nature of wind power, loading and generating conditions. This is undesirable and results in system instability. If these LFO modes are not controlled, it may lead to a power interruption and results in unstable. The LFO modes are damped by Power System Stabilizers (PSS). However, it causes variation in voltage profile resulting in reduction instability of the system during large disturbances. In such cases, the flexible ac transmission system controllers are required. This paper presents and compares the PSS, Static synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) and Static Var Compensator (SVC) controller by replacing Synchronous Generator (SG) with same rated wind farm and various wind power penetration levels by considering system uncertainties such as wind speed. In this paper, a robust coordinated method is proposed using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimizing parameters of controllers of PSS, SVC, and STATCOM. The real part and damping ratio of eigenvalues is the objective function for PSO and is formulated based on the small-signal and transient analysis. Controller locations are determined by the deterministic method, probabilistic method and power flow sensitivity analysis. An eigenvalue analysis approach based on the linearization of a nonlinear system using a state-space model is conducted to analyse the Small Signal Stability performance. Time-domain simulation is carried out for transient stability under large disturbance. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approaches for transient and small-signal stability are evaluated on the IEEE-14-bus system. The results reveal that the proposed location and optimized gain parameters for controllers effectively damped the LFOs. It also intensifies the transient capability under extreme disturbances and shows enhancement in system stability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely employed to support various Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile applications. By leveraging the advantages of easily deployed and flexibility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), one of MEC primary functions is employing UAVs equipped with MEC servers to provide computation supports for the offloaded tasks by mobile users in temporally hotspot areas or some emergent scenarios, such as sports game areas or destroyed by natural disaster areas. Despite the numerous advantages of UAV carried with a MEC server, it is restricted by its limited computation resources and sensitive energy consumption. Moreover, due to the complexity of UAV-assisted MEC system, its computational resource optimization and energy consumption optimization cannot be achieved well in traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, the computational cost of the MEC system optimization is often exponentially growing with the increase of the MEC servers and mobile users. Therefore, it is considerably challenging to control the UAV positions and schedule the task offloading ratio. In this paper, we proposed a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to optimize UAV trajectory controlling and users' offloaded task ratio scheduling and improve the performance of the UAV-assisted MEC system. We maximized the system stability and minimized the energy consumption and computation latency of UAV-assisted the MEC system. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing work and has better scalability. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of people's living standards, large-scaled public activities have increased considerably, and the emergency probability has increased greatly. When an emergency occurs, the emergency evacuation can effectively reduce casualties and economic losses. Therefore, how to quickly evacuate crowd is a current research hotspot in this field. The path planning of emergency evacuation is one of the effective ways to implement the crowd evacuation. Aiming at the problem of path planning for emergency evacuation and taking the grid map as the background, the ant colony cellular optimization (ACCO) algorithm is proposed as the path planning algorithm based on the cellular automata theory and ant colony algorithm. Firstly, in order to solve the problem of inconsistent time steps in the quadrilateral grid map, the grid map based on hexagonal cell is established and the ACCO algorithm is developed based on the hexagonal grid map. And the method of solving grid coordinate is given. Then, in order to improve the convergence speed and search ability of the ACCO algorithm, the static field is used to optimize the heuristic function, and the segment update rule is used to optimize the pheromone update method. Finally, the parameters of ACCO algorithm are optimized through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The method of designing the fitness evaluation function is proposed, and the optimal combination of parameters of the ACCO algorithm is implemented according to the fitness function. In order to verify the scientificity and effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this research and also to systematically verify the optimization strategy, in this research the exhibition hall on the B-deck of a large cruise ship is used as the engineering background, and the traditional algorithm and the ACCO algorithm are adopted to perform the simulations. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional quadrilateral grid, the hexagonal grid proposed in this research unifies the simulation time step and can be used as the division method of the simulation environment. At the same time, the ACCO algorithm can effectively perform the evacuation path planning, and the optimization strategy proposed in this research not only acceletates the search speed, but also increases the solution space and improves the search ability, which can effectively avoid falling into the local optimal solution. © 2020 Chinese Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have received widespread attentiveness in several civil and military fields. The implementation of ecological surveillance and scanning applications has very specific limitations in terms of energy, cost, weight, and flight durability. Drones can be used for the rapid delivery of any and supplies. But, due to the limited flight time of battery-powered electric drones in air transportation, this paper aims to propose firstly the development of a sustainable power system for long-flight drone propulsion applications. Generally, the use of Jacobian linearization in the entire Taylor series expansion at the nominal operating point does not achieve satisfactory dynamic performance under sudden load changes. Therefore, the research methodology is based on nonlinear dynamic models that have been developed for fuel cell, lithium-ion battery, the structure of the buck converter, and the controller. The proposed system is designed and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software. The findings show that the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller can be proposed to transform the stack voltage to standard DC for satisfactory transient operation, the PID controller can be adjusted through the gradient descend multi-parameter optimization technology, and the simulation results show that the hybrid mixture of hydrogen fuel cell and lithium-ion battery can verify the ability of the designed system to meet the long endurance UAV power requirements, and keep the output voltage constant in the case of sudden load changes.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the emergence and development of UAVs and the improvement of the miniaturization and intelligence of various sensor, UAVs equipped with sensors have become an efficient tool for obtaining spatial data. Because UAVs are low cost, short revisit period, fast and efficient, light and flexible, simple operation, and high temporal and spatial accuracy of image acquisition, it is widely used in mining land damage monitoring. Using “UAV, Inversion, Soil Monitoring, Surface Collapse, Ground Fissure” as keywords, this paper summarizes the academic papers of the search system in the web of science, CNKI, and Google Scholar from January 2010 to May 2021. Through comparing and analyzing the differences between drone monitoring technology and other detection technologies, the drone monitoring of heavy metals, soil moisture content, and salt content in mining areas is reviewed. The general process and data processing methods of the measurement, surface subsidence, ground fissures and slope stability, and the application prospects of UAVs in surface soil characteristics and geological disaster monitoring in mining areas are summarized. It is believed that in the future, it is possible to integrate field time series tracking investigation, high-precision soil quality monitoring technology, high-spatial resolution drone monitoring technology, digital simulation methods, and test monitoring and analysis of typical working faces to study the coupling relationship between geohazards and soil quality evolution in the dynamic advancement of the working face from the open-off cut to the stop of mining. The coupled relationship is to construct a theoretical system and time series evolution model for the prediction of soil quality evolution in coal mining subsidence areas. This will further explore the relationship between soil quality in mining areas and geological disasters, and propose measures to mitigate, control and improve soil quality in mining areas, providing technical support for the coordinated and sustainable development of coal resource mining and ecological environment in China's coal production bases. © 2022 Meitiandizhi Yu Kantan/Coal Geology and Exploration.

	abstract = {In the aftermath of a large-scale disaster, such as an earthquake, existing telecommunication (e.g., cellular towers) and other public infrastructures (e.g., power lines, roads, etc.) are often severely damaged. This prevents the seamless exchange of situational awareness and rescue/relief based information between the volunteers, shelter points, and the coordination center. A temporary communication infrastructure utilizing smartphones, communication towers, drones, smart badges, etc., commonly referred to as network resources, can be formed, which promises to bridge the communication gap between various stakeholders in the disaster area and enable timely information exchange between them. However, the efficacy of such networks is often challenged by the limited availability of network resources in the disaster area. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to design, develop, and test a novel strategy that intelligently deploys the limited network resources in the disaster area, and thus, creates an efficient temporary communication infrastructure in such resource-constrained post-disaster situations. We formulate the network resource deployment (ResDep) problem as an integer linear programming optimization problem and show that it is NP-Hard. Next, we propose a near-optimal polynomial-time heuristic solution for solving it. Our extensive simulation study on top of ONE simulator and proof-of-concept pilot deployment study, both based on our university, National Institute of Technology — Durgapur, India, reveal that the proposed heuristic performs nearly as well as that of the optimal solution (computed using Gurobi optimizer), and outperforms its variant and baseline approaches when compared in terms of end-to-end network latency and message delivery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An application field of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) is within victim rescue operations. The main challenge faced by disaster rescue teams is response time. The chances of finding survivors decrease significantly over time and dramatically decrease after 48 hours. In this context, the motivation of this work is to present an MRS inspired by the concepts of swarm robotics to rescue victims in unknown environments. In this case, the robots are unaware of the search area boundaries and obstacles, knowing the number of victims to be rescued as a stopping criterion for the simulations made in Matlab®. Therefore, three approaches inheriting the main aspects of fuzzy logic are used based on previous works: a fuzzy logic controller (FLC), a dynamic fuzzy cognitive map (DFCM) controller, and a DFCM inspired by the ant colony optimization metaheuristic (DFCM- ACO). The proposed task simulates real life disaster rescue operations, or even humans lost in unfamiliar environments such as forests. The simulations were performed in three environments in order to test the overall robustness against unpredictable situations, autonomy, explored area and processing time for both approaches using a subsumption-based architecture. In general, the results suggest that the DFCM-based MRS approaches are able to complete the tasks consuming less processing time, with robots travelling shorter distances to explore a similar environment to the FLC approach and with the DFCM-ACO presenting balanced results between the other techniques. Finally, future works are outlined. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the continuous construction of reservoir group systems and the improvement in flood control objectives in China, a demand has arisen for joint flood control operations of reservoir groups in river basins. However, the existing conventional flood control operation rule (CFCOR) of most reservoirs are based generally on a simple discriminant and there is a lack of coordination among the reservoir group. Further, owing to a shortage of high-precision, long-term forecasting schemes and forecasting professionals for reservoirs in small and medium river basins, it is difficult to obtain acceptable results when applying the forecasting-operation mode. Therefore, an optimal joint flood control operation rule (OJFCOR) of parallel reservoir groups is proposed in this study based on the Aggregation–Decomposition method (AGDP). This proposed rule comprises the aggregated reservoir flood control operation chart and the decomposition strategy named occupied flood regulation storage capacity ratio method (OFRSCR). We applied the simulation-optimisation method (SLOS) nested annealing accuracy penalty function method-adaptive multi-variant particle swarm optimisation (AAPF-AMPSO) to optimise OJFCOR, with the objective function being the maximum average peak-cutting rate of the flood control section. A case study was conducted with a parallel reservoir group located in the upper reaches of the Lijiang River basin (URLRB). Our results showed that, compared with the widely used inflow ratio method (IR), the performance of OFRSCR was a more suitable decomposition strategy and superior in maintaining the synchronisation of the parallel reservoir group. Further, OJFCOR showed a satisfactory peak-cutting effect on floods with different rainstorm centres and flood magnitudes, with the average flood peak-cutting rate of 37.68%, which is superior to those of CFCOR (25.26%) and DP (32.69%), but inferior to that of POA-DPSA (45.23%). Besides strong peak-cutting ability and strong adaptability, OJFCOR also has advantages of smooth outflow process and being convenient for professional operators. Generally, the OJFCOR proposed in this research was found reasonable and effective, and it was shown suitable for practical real-time flood control operations and reducing the effects of flood disasters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Deploying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted base stations with a renewable energy charging infrastructure in a temporary event (e.g., sporadic hotspots for light reconnaissance mission or disaster-struck areas where regular power-grid is unavailable) provides a responsive and cost-effective solution for cellular networks. Nevertheless, the energy constraint incurred by renewable energy (e.g., solar panel) imposes new challenges on the recharging coordination. The amount of available energy at a charging station (CS) at any given time is variable depending on: the time of day, the location, sunlight availability, size and quality factor of the solar panels used, etc. Uncoordinated UAVs make redundant recharging attempts and result in severe quality of service (QoS) degradation. The system stability and lifetime depend on the coordination between the UAVs and available CSs. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning time-step based algorithm for the UAV recharging scheduling and coordination using a Q-Learning approach. The agent is considered a central controller of the UAVs in the system, which uses the ϵ-greedy based action selection. The goal of the algorithm is to maximize the average achieved throughput, reduce the number of recharging occurrences, and increase the life-span of the network. Extensive simulations based on experimentally validated UAV and charging energy models reveal that our approach exceeds the benchmark strategies by 381% in system duration, 47% reduction in the number of recharging occurrences, and achieved 66% of the performance in average throughput compared to a power-grid based infrastructure where there are no energy limitations on the CSs. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With increasing concerns on climate change and energy shortage, manufacturing industries must adopt more sustainable production and facility control strategies. Such strategies require operational practices that emphasize sustainability by considering economic, energy, and environmental aspects simultaneously. In this paper, a new combined production scheduling model that jointly considers energy control and maintenance implementation to address the concerns of energy consumption, intelligent maintenance, and throughput improvement simultaneously is proposed. Multiple measures are combined and evaluated using a single objective, i.e., cost minimization. Particle swarm optimization, with a local optimal avoidable mechanism and a time varying inertial weight, is used to solve the cost minimization problem to find a near optimal solution of production and maintenance schedules. A numerical case study is implemented and the results show that the cost per unit production can be reduced up to 27% compared to the existing benchmark strategies. The implications to practitioners with respect to the tradeoff between cost and throughput/energy consumption, and the model applicability considering energy tariff structure, are also discussed to provide more insights for using the proposed joint model in the real world. The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art on maintenance and energy scheduling, which is typically performed exclusively. It is expected to guide operational activities on shop floors toward sustainability. © 2013 IEEE.},

The conflicting multiple schedule goals, such as time, fairness, and cost, should be taken into consideration together in an earthquake emergency resource schedule. A three-objective optimization model with constraints is constructed according to earthquake emergency resource schedule problems. An Adaptive MultiObjective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based on Evolutionary State Evaluation (AMOPSO/ESE) is proposed to optimize this model for obtaining the Pareto optimal set. At the same time, based on the decision behavior pattern of "macro first and micro later", the two-level optimal solution sets consisting of an interest optimal solution set and their neighborhood optimal solution sets are proposed to represent the Pareto front roughly, which can simplify the decision-making process. The simulation results show that the multiobjective resource schedules can be effectively obtained by the AMOPSO/ESE algorithm, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the chosen competed algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity. © 2020, Science Press.

	abstract = {This article proposes a tidal resource evaluation-based planning method for profitable and reasonable allocations of tidal current generation farms (TCGFs). The directionality and variability of tidal current velocity (TCV) and their correlation are addressed. First, a TCGF power output model is developed. The correlations between tidal current directions and the probability distributions of TCV magnitudes are modeled by rose diagram, and wake effects in TCGFs are simulated by the semi-Analytical wake model. Second, a tidal current resource evaluation method is proposed to determine the TCGF's capacity. An optimization planning model is proposed to optimally coordinate tidal current turbine (TCT) micrositing, offshore substation position selection and the ECS planning scheme. The positions of TCTs and substation are modeled by continuous coordinates. The objective is to minimize the levelized cost of energy, subject to the geographical boundary and security operation requirements of the TCGF. Third, the Prufer number-based particle swarm optimization (PN-PSO) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed planning model. The requirements of ECS radial topology and no cable crossings can be fully satisfied. Finally, the measured TCV data collected from Alaska and North Orkney Islands were used to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a major research topic in robotics, despite their existence since 1915. UAVs can perform various activities efficiently and effectively; therefore, involving a group of UAVs in performing a certain task has become a growing research trend. Research involving multiple UAVs has been carried out in various areas such as force protection, warfare in the military, remote sensing, disaster response activities, and surveillance. While performing critical tasks, efficiency and robustness are important considerations that can be achieved by involving heterogeneous UAV teams with effective communication and coordination techniques. Communication among heterogeneous UAVs is an interesting and critical research area that needs to be thoroughly explored. In this research, an evidence-based approach is adopted to explore research carried out on multiple heterogeneous UAVs and their communication patterns while performing various activities. A mapping study research technique is employed to systematically collect, analyze, and assess the evidence available on the topic under discussion. The time period defined for this study was set from 2005 to 2019, and 46 primary studies were considered for thematic analysis. The findings show that research studies fall under the category of validation research by constructing simulations to provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed solutions. The communication patterns among heterogeneous UAVs involve various components of UAV communication, networking, formation, and path planning. The application areas that were largely focused on were search, rescue, monitoring, and surveillance missions. The overall trend showed that interest in multiple heterogeneous UAV usage increases over time with a focus on UAV networks, formations, and path planning while considering communication as an implicit part of all these structures. This research has conducted an in-depth analysis of existing research on heterogeneous UAVs and provides classification and trends of various themes emerging within this research area. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of blockchain in cyber-physical systems, such as robotics, is an area with immense potential to address many shortcomings in robotic coordination and control. In traditional swarm robotic applications, where homogeneous robots are utilized, it is possible to replace a robot if it malfunctions, and it can be assumed that all robots are interchangeable. However, in many real-world applications spanning from search and rescue missions to future household robotic appliances, heterogeneous robots will need to work together with the other robots and human agents to achieve specific tasks. Nevertheless, no such system exists. Therefore, we propose a system that utilizes a token economy for robotic agents that makes agents responsive to token acquisition as an incentive for collaboration in achieving a given task. The economy enables the system to self-govern, even under Byzantine and adversarial settings. We further incorporate a novel subcontracting framework within a blockchain environment to allow the robotic agents to efficiently and cost-effectively perform complex jobs requiring multiple agents with various capabilities. We conducted a thorough evaluation of the system in a prototype warehouse application scenario, and the results are promising. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It is well proved that remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPASs) are very useful systems for remote sensing in precision agricultural labors. INTA (National Institute for Aerospace Applications) and the University of Huelva are involved in Tecnolivo Project that proposes the development of a marketable and easy-to-use technological solution that allows integrated, ecological, and optimized management of the olive grove through non-invasive monitoring of key agronomic parameters using RPASs. The information collected by the RPAS in regards to the state of the vegetation, such as hydric stress levels, plague detection, or maturation of the fruit, are very interesting for farmers when it comes to make decisions about their crops. Current RPAS applications for precision agriculture are mainly developed for small- to medium-sized crops using rotary-wing RPASs with small range and endurance operation, leaving aside large-sized crops. This work shows the conversion of a fully declassified and obsolete fixed-wing internal combustion engine (ICE) remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), used as aerial target for military applications and in reconnaissance and surveillance missions at low cost, into an electric lithium polymer (LiPo) battery-driven RPA that will be used for precision agriculture in large-sized crop applications, as well as other applications for tracking and monitoring of endangered animal species in national parks. This RPA, being over twenty years old, has undergone a deep change. The applied methodology consisted of the design of a new propulsion system, based on an electric motor and batteries, maintaining the main airworthiness characteristics of the aircraft. Some other novelties achieved in this study were: (1) Change to a more effcient engine, less heavy and bulky, with a greater ratio of torque vs. size. Modernization of the fly control system and geolocation system. (2) Modification of the type and material of the propeller, reaching a higher performance. (3) Replacement of a polluting fuel, such as gasoline, with electricity from renewable sources. (4) Development of a new control software, etc. Preliminary results indicate that the endurance achieved with the new energy and propulsion systems and the payload weight available in the RPA meet the expectations of the use of this type of RPAS in the study of large areas of crops and surveillance. © 2020 by authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing techniques have significant potential in agriculture and smart farming applications for the efficient monitoring of plant growth, the irrigation process, disease detection, etc. Most research on field phenotyping with remote sensing was accomplished by a typical UAV equipped with an RGB camera or a multispectral camera over a large farm field. Due to the effects of wind disturbances on point-cloud generation processing with a single-camera image captured from the UAV, precise field phenotyping measurement for crop breeding and agriculture production requires the simultaneous collection of images by multiple cameras that are far enough apart to provide for structure from motion calculations. To improve digital surface models by minimizing measurement errors caused by the motion of the UAV and plants during a flying mission, a cooperative operation system of multiple UAVs was proposed to enable the simultaneous collection of images from different perspectives. A coordinated navigation system based on the Robot Operation System was constructed to compute control commands to stabilize pose control and the location of the UAVs. Based on a leader-follower formation control algorithm through a wireless network system, a follower UAV performed coordination with a leader UAV to maintain the desired constant speed, direction, and percentage of image overlap in a synchronized motion, ultimately enabling task achievement in a short time and improvement of target models based on 3D reconstruction. To validate the performance of the proposed method, measurement errors of field phenotyping, obtained from synchronized multiple UAV-based image collection, were compared with the single UAV-based image collection in simulation and field tests. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the recent progress of a multi-year project investigating the concept of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being partially powered by the natural environment the drone will encounter along its flight path. This UAV flight is achieved using power generation, management, and storage systems. The aircraft's improvement in sustainability, or endurance, is the main benefit of this design as it harvests energy from the environment available to it, and also using the potential of replacing some of the UAV structure with the structure of the power storage devices to reduce parasitic weight. These UAV enhancements could have many beneficial applications for a modern technological society. Applications in defense are numerous, as a highly sustainable aircraft can provide longterm surveillance over essential targets. Also, weather monitoring can benefit immensely from a highly sustainable drone, as these drones will be able to follow weather patterns as they develop over time and achieve real time updates. The power generation comes from three sources: flexible solar panels, thermoelectric generators, and vibration induced power generation motors (installed in power pods or inside the wing) that are excited by either atmospheric gusts or wing flutter. These forms of AC and DC current will be combined into usable energy for the UAV energy storage devices. Utilizing these forms of energy should in theory greatly extend the flight time of the UAV as it will continually cycle through these different forms of energy throughout the day and night. The flexible solar cells will be either attached onto the wing or replace the wing upper skin structure and take in the energy from the sun during the day, outputting straight DC current. The vibration induced power generation devices are comprised of DC motors attached to leaf springs and a gear/rack mechanism that oscillate from the vibrations of the wings to spin the motor shaft and generate AC power. The thermoelectric generators will generate energy from heat flux across the hot and cold plates of the power management system and the solar cells. All these sources are combined into a single power output via the power management system (PWMS). The PWMS is based off a hybrid power design, where the input sources are combined into a single stable DC output in which lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries or graphene supercapacitors can be charged and discharged into the UAV electric motor driven propeller load. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The data volume is exploding due to various newly-developing applications that call for stringent communication requirements towards 5th generation wireless systems. Fortunately, mobile edge computing makes it possible to relieve the heavy computation pressure of ground users and decrease the latency and energy consumption. What is more, the unmanned aerial vehicle has the advantages of agility and easy deployment, which gives the unmanned aerial vehicle enabled mobile edge computing system opportunities to fly towards areas with communication demand, such as hotspot areas. However, the limited endurance time of unmanned aerial vehicle affects the performance of mobile edge computing services, which results in the incomplete mobile edge computing services under the time limit. Consequently, this paper concerns the energy-efficient scheme design of the unmanned aerial vehicle while providing high-quality offloading services for ground users, particularly in the regions where the ground communication infrastructures are overloaded or damaged after natural disasters. Firstly, the model of energy-efficient design of the unmanned aerial vehicle is set up taking the constraints of the energy limitation of the unmanned aerial vehicle, the data causality, and the speed of the unmanned aerial vehicle into account. Subsequently, aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the unmanned aerial vehicle in the unmanned aerial vehicle enabled mobile edge computing system, the bits allocation in each time slot and the trajectory of the unmanned aerial vehicle are jointly optimized. Secondly, a successive convex approximation based alternating algorithm is brought forward to deal with the non-convex energy efficiency maximization problem.

	abstract = {Power-to-gas (P2G) technology provides a new way for the renewable energy accommodation. However, the application and development of P2G technology are limited by the problems of high investment cost and poor economic characteristics. In order to realize the accommodation of curtailed wind power and improve the economy of P2G, the paper firstly proposes to use curtailed wind power to produce natural gas through P2G technology. Natural gas is stored in gas storage tank, and participates in the operation scene of frequency regulation through the nature gas generation unit (NGGU). The coordinated operation strategy of each equipment is proposed. Secondly, according to the above operation strategies, the cost-benefit model of P2G, gas storage tank and NGGU participating in the frequency regulation process is constructed with the goal of maximizing the income, in order to achieve the optimal capacity configuration of each equipment. Finally, the actual curtailed wind power of a certain wind farm and the actual dispatching commands of an automatic generation control (AGC) unit are used as a reference, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for planning calculation. The calculation results analyze the economy and feasibility by using curtailed wind power and P2G technology to participate in frequency regulation auxiliary service of the electricity market with the optimal configuration of P2G, gas storage tank and NGGU capacity. © 2020 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.},

The suggested solution seeks to improve the efficiency of the rolling mill, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to minimize the cost of the electrical energy utilized in the manufacture of steel coils, to increase the power system chargeability and to guarantee power quality. The proposal consists in constituting a virtual plant (comprising the wind farm and the rolling mill) to be managed by a single operator. The approach is mainly focused on the management of the virtual plant reactive power. The algorithm proposed to optimize this reactive power is based on the so-called particle swarm optimization. Three optimization strategies are analyzed: minimization of losses in the distribution network, minimization of the voltage deviation at two of its nodes, and maximization of the displacement factor in both the rolling mill and the wind farm. Losses are reduced by up to 15.5% when adopting the first strategy in comparison to the least efficient case. Voltage variations are kept at less than 1% at both nodes when using the second strategy, whereas deviations between 1.5 and 4% are obtained when implementing the other two strategies. The study is based on actual measurements and simulation tests. © 2021 IEEE.},

Iterative multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique and wireless sensor networks (WSN) are combined to achieve accurate localization and auxiliary formation control. Iterative MDS algorithm is utilized to obtain the topology of the robot swarm, i.e., relative positions of all the robots. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is used as reference in the following coordinate transformation process. Then the global localization is achieved with high precision. With a better knowledge of the position of each other, the robots are able to maintain a more orderly formation during movement.

	abstract = {Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in emergency communications is a promising technology because of their flexible deployment, low cost, and high mobility. However, due to the limited energy of the onboard battery, the service duration of the UAV is greatly limited. In this paper, we study an emerging energy-efficient UAV emergency network, where a UAV works as an aerial base station to serve a group of users with different statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints in the downlink. In particular, the energy efficiency of the UAV is defined as the sum effective capacity of the downlink users divided by the energy consumption of the UAV, which includes the energy consumed by communication and the energy consumed by hovering. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the energy efficiency of the UAV by jointly optimizing the UAV's altitude, downlink transmit power, and bandwidth allocation while meeting a statistical delay QoS requirement for each user. The formulated optimization problem is a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem of fractional programming, which is difficult to solve. In order to deal with the nonconvex optimization problem, the following two steps are used. First, we transform the fractional objective function into a tractable subtractive function. Second, we decompose the original optimization problem into three subproblems, and then, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain the energy efficiency maximization value by using the Dinkelbach method, the block coordinate descent, and the successive convex optimization technique. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has significant energy savings compared with a benchmark scheme. © 2021 Haibin Niu et al.},

	abstract = {The increasing trend towards a higher level of autonomy in unmanned aerial systems (UASs) had led to lower requirements for control by the human operator and to an increasing capability to perform complex tasks by reacting to the environmental influences. Nevertheless, current UASs are designed to function in static and predictable environments. Therefore, it is envisaged that the existing uncertainties and dynamic changes, caused when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is operating in an unknown environment, would reduce its performance significantly. The uncertainties can be also incurred through interaction with other complex and intelligent systems, such as humans. We present a compact literature survey of UAS control and navigation as a basic knowledge to develop UASs from the perspective of the control engineer. Besides, we present several control strategies to maintain a UAS, as well as multi-UASs, under a network setting under various scenarios. Several simulations are given to illustrate the performance of the controllers in MATLAB®. Advances in computing power and algorithms currently enable the development of systems with a high degree of autonomy. Nonetheless, there is a large gap between practical operation in the real-world and laboratory implementation, as safe deployment of UASs requires validation of their behavior under almost all envisaged scenarios. A reliable and autonomous operation of such a system requires design and development of a cognitive control system that acquires knowledge and understanding of the surrounding environment via perception, reasoning, and learning. Cognitive control systems in UASs will enhance their safety and performance. Cognitive control can also be used in cooperative execution of complex tasks where multiple agents such as humans, machines, or both interact. Such UASs will have a great potential to be used in extreme environments such as search and rescue in the case of disaster, nuclear decommissioning operations, deep-sea exploration, mining, etc. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In recent years, inspired by technological progress and the outstanding performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in several local wars, the UAV industry has witnessed explosive development, widely used in communication relay, logistics, surveying and mapping, patrol, surveillance, and other fields. Vertical Take-Off and Landing fixed-wing UAV has both the advantages of vertical take-off and landing of rotorcraft and the advantages of long endurance of fixed-wing UAV, which broadened its application field and is the most popular UAV at present. Recently, fixed-wing UAV failure analysis highlights that cruise engine shutdown is the most common reason for emergency landing, which is also a governing factor for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) fixed-wing UAV failures. Nevertheless, the emergency landing trajectory of the latter UAV type after engine shutdown is different from that of the conventional fixed-wing UAVs due to the VTOL power system. Hence, spurred by the requirement of a safe emergency landing trajectory for VTOL fixed-wing UAVs, this paper develops an architecture capable of safe emergency landing for such platforms. The suggested method develops a particle dynamics model of the VTOL UAV and analyzes its aerodynamic characteristics utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. The UAV's trajectory is divided into three parts for enhanced planning. For the guidance stage, the initial position and heading angle are arbitrary. Hence, the Dubins shortest cross-range and the fastest descent trajectory are adopted to steer the UAV above the landing window quickly. The spiral stage comprises a conical and cylindrical part combined with a spiral descent trajectory of variable radius for energy management and landing course alignment. Given the limited energy storage of VTOL power systems, the landing stage exploits an optimal control trajectory problem solved by a Gaussian pseudospectral method, involving trajectory conventional landing planning, unpowered landing, distance optimal landing, and wind-resistant landing. All trajectories meet the dynamics constraints, terminal constraints, and sliding performance constraints and cover both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional trajectories. A large number of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed trajectories manage broad applicability and strong feasibility for VTOL fixed-wing UAVs.  © 2021 Zhao Deng et al.},

	abstract = {Thanks to their capabilities to track objects and events of interest as well as their capabilities to provide unique real-time views of road sections, drones are being increasingly used in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. To deal with the highly complex ITS tasks, several approaches are allowing these drones to collaborate and ultimately achieve goals beyond their individual capabilities. Moreover, recent approaches are highlighting the need to empower drones with intelligence and autonomy, particularly to enable them react more efficiently to changes in the commonly open and highly dynamic ITS environments. Intelligence and autonomy will also enable drones optimize the use of their limited onboard resources. Within this perspective, we are proposing in this paper an intelligent drone collaboration approach using the Multi-Agent System paradigm. Based on a new generic Belief-Intension-Desire (BDI) architecture, our approach implements a five-dimension social model that mimics humans’ reasoning and interactions. In contrast with the existing approaches, our solution enables drones to switch between selfish and collaborative behaviors. To demonstrate some benefits of our BDI architecture, we run simulations of two types of collaboration approaches; namely Collaboration based on Centralized Planning and Collaboration based on Participatory Planning. Our simulations are run to manage road traffic in the advent of an emergency situation like the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Low-cost and high-mobility drones become important contributors to build up such kind of emergency communication networks. In this paper, we consider the drone as a deployed base station to provide communication for ground users in the post-disaster area. Considering the importance of providing guaranteed service for rescuers (compared to normal users), we have investigated power and subcarrier allocation to maximize the downlink system capacity in the drone-assisted emergency communication system. Due to the complexity of the formulated problem. a suboptimal solution is proposed by dividing users into two priority groups: high-priority users (rescuers) and low-priority users (affected people). According to analyses, the complexity of the proposed scheme is much lower than the optimal scheme. Simulation results have shown that when the transmit power of the drone is not very high, the performance of the proposed resource allocation scheme is very close to the optimal scheme. © 2020 IEEE.},

In particular, the integration of a 7 DOFs (degrees of freedom) manipulator and a mobile frame results in a reconfigurable workspace, which opens to samples collection and inspection in non-structured environments. Moreover, Agri. q mounts an orientable landing platform for drones which is made of solar panels, enabling multirobot strategies and solar power storage, with a view to sustainable energy.

	abstract = {A three-dimensional localization method is proposed to calculate the coordinates of a ground-based stationary target for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is based on multipoint observations and does not depend on the distance measurement. A recursive least-squares estimation of the relative height from the target to the UAV was carried out using the visual axis projection method, and the estimated value was introduced into the three-dimensional observation model as a measured quantity to meet the observability requirement. A Kalman filtering method was used to estimate the 3D coordinates of the target in real time. To analyze the influence of observation distance and sampling interval on localization, the minimum sample number and average estimation error were used as criteria in Monte Carlo simulations. The influence and sensitivity of UAV position error, attitude angle error, gimbal directional angle error, and image pixel position error were analyzed. The simulation results show that the ground target localization algorithm can effectively calculate the 3D coordinates of the target point in real time, and the localization error is within the allowable range, which has prospects for engineering applications. Reducing the observation distance and sampling interval and using an observing angle of nearly 45° are helpful for improving the precision of target localization. The gimbal directional angle error is the most important factor that influences the accuracy of target localization. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The airborne mobile wireless networks (AMWNs) composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communication networks is one of the emerging application scenarios of the Space-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks in 6G. Due to its high mobility, UAV exhibits great advantages in assisted cellular network communication and emergency communication. The multi-antenna technology and quality of service (QoS) can help cellular networks reduce latency and improve network capacity. In this paper, we jointly optimize the transmit power and flight trajectory of the multiuser MISO UAV communication system to improve the total effective capacity of the system. Specifi-cally, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and block diagonalization are adopted to eliminate multiuser interference. In addition, the optimization problem with regard to maximizing the total effective capacity of the system under the condition of delay constraint is proposed. Furthermore, an iterative optimization algorithm jointly considering UAV trajectory and subchannel transmit power is considered, in which we use successive convex optimization techniques and the block coordinate descent method to solve the thorny non-convex problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robot swarms can accomplish demanding missions fast, efficiently, and accurately. For a robust operation, robot swarms need to be equipped with reliable localization algorithms. Usually, the global positioning system (GPS) and motion capture cameras are employed to provide robot swarms with absolute position data with high precision. However, such infrastructures make the robots dependent on certain areas and hence reduce robustness. Thus, robots should have onboard localization capabilities to demonstrate a swarm behavior in challenging scenarios such as GPS-denied environments. Motivated by the need for a reliable onboard localization framework for robot swarms, we present a distance and vision-based localization algorithm integrated into a distributed formation control framework for three-drone systems. The proposed approach is established upon the bearing angles and the relative distances between the pairs of drones in a cyclic formation where each drone follows its coleader. We equip each drone with a monocular camera sensor and derive the bearing angle between a drone and its coleader with the recently developed deep learning algorithms. The onboard measurements are then relayed back to the formation control algorithm in which every drone computes its control action in its own frame based on its neighbors only, forming a completely distributed architecture. The proposed approach enables three-drone systems to perform in coordination indepen- dent of any external infrastructure. We validate the performance of our approach in a realistic simulation environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this article, a bi-level multi-objective optimization framework is presented, with the aim of simultaneously designing the configuration of wind turbines (WTs) as well as the topology of electrical collector system in an offshore WF. The installation capacity of the WF, the positioning of the WTs and the planning scheme of the electrical systemare balanced to achieve a better performance of the WF. In this proposal, there is an outer layer along with two inner layers. The objectives of the outer-layer model are the maximization of the WF's daily profit rate, the daily average capacity factor, and power quality. It is tackled by the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III). The objectives of the two inner layer models are to determine the topology of the electrical system and the generation schedule of other generators, and are solved by means of the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm and the quadratic programming (QP) method respectively. The WF is assumed to be connected to the IEEE-24 bus test system.

	abstract = {Human-machine teaming (HMT) operates in a context defined by the mission. Varying from the complexity and disturbance in the cooperation between humans and machines, a single machine has difficulty handling work with humans in the scales of efficiency and workload. Swarm of machines provides a more feasible solution in such a mission. Human-swarm teaming (HST) extends the concept of HMT in the mission, such as persistent surveillance, search-and-rescue, warfare. Bringing the concept of HST faces several scientific challenges. For example, the strategies of allocation on the high-level decision making. Here, human usually plays the supervisory or decision making role. Performance of such fixed structure of HST in actual mission operation could be affected by the supervisor's status from many aspects, which could be considered in three general parts: workload, situational awareness, and trust towards the robot swarm teammate and mission performance. Besides, the complexity of a single human operator in accessing multiple machine agents increases the work burdens. An interface between swarm teammates and human operators to simplify the interaction process is desired in the HST.In this paper, instead of purely considering the workload of human teammates, we propose the computational model of human swarm interaction (HSI) in the simulated map surveillance mission. UAV swarm and human supervisor are both assigned in searching a predefined area of interest (AOI). The workload allocation of map monitoring is adjusted based on the status of the human worker and swarm teammate. Workload, situation awareness ability, trust are formulated as independent models, which affect each other. A communication-aware UAV swarm persistent surveillance algorithm is assigned in the swarm autonomy portion. With the different surveillance task loads, the swarm agent's thrust parameter adjusts the autonomy level to fit the human operator's needs. Reinforcement learning is applied in seeking the relative balance of workload in both human and swarm sides. Metrics such as mission accomplishment rate, human supervisor performance, mission performance of UAV swarm are evaluated in the end. The simulation results show that the algorithm could learn the human-machine trust interaction to seek the workload balance to reach better mission execution performance. This work inspires us to leverage a more comprehensive HST model in more practical HMT application scenarios.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most of the vehicle manufacturers aim to deploy level-5 fully autonomous ground vehicles (FAGVs) on city roads in 2021 by leveraging extensive existing knowledge about sensors, actuators, telematics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) gained from the level-3 and level-4 autonomy. FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS). Cities currently designed for cars can turn into cities developed for citizens using FAGVinSCF enabling more sustainable cities.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs, Drones), initially known only for their military applications, are getting increasingly popular in the civil sector as well. Over the military canvas, drones have already proven themselves as a potent force multiplier through unmanned, round-the-clock, long-range and high-endurance missions for surveillance, reconnaissance, search and rescue, and even armed combat applications. With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), commercial deployments of drones are also growing exponentially, ranging from cargo and taxi services to agriculture, disaster relief, risk assessment and monitoring of critical infrastructures. Irrespective of the deployment sector, drones are often entrusted to conduct safety, time and liability critical tasks, thus requiring secure, robust and trustworthy operations. In contrast, the rise in UAVs' demand, coupled with market pressure to reduce size, weight, power and cost (SwaP-C) parameters, has caused vendors to often ignore security aspects, thus inducing serious safety and security threats. As UAVs rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning and navigation, they can fall prey to GPS jamming and spoofing attacks. The vulnerability of GPS to spoofing has serious implications for UAVs, as victim drones using civil GPS can be misdirected or even completely hijacked for malicious intents, as already demonstrated in several academic research efforts using commercially available GPS spoofing hardware. Beside UAVs, GPS spoofing attacks are equally applicable to other GPS-dependent platforms, including manned aircraft, ground vehicles, and cellular systems. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of GPS spoofing threats, with a special focus on their applicability over UAVs and other GPS-dependent mobile platforms. It presents a novel taxonomy of GPS spoofing attacks and critically analyzes different spoofing techniques based upon placement of spoofing device, attack stealthiness, attack methodologies, and objectives of the attacker. We also discuss some of the recent experiments from open literature which utilized commercially available hardware for successfully conducting spoofing attacks. Copyright 2021 Khan et al.},

The reason is that UAVs have abilities to perform some difficult or dangerous tasks, with high mobility, safety, and low cost. It should be noted that UAVs are revolutionizing many public services including real time monitoring, search and rescue, wildlife surveys, delivery services, wireless coverage, and precision agriculture. To increase endurance and achieve good performance, UAVs generally use a hybrid power supply system architecture. A hybrid power architecture may combine several power sources such as fuel cell, battery, solar cells, and supercapacitor. The choice of a suitable power source hybridization architecture with an optimal energy management system are therefore crucial to enable an efficient operation of advanced UAVs.

	abstract = {Thanks to technological advances in information and communications, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (aka drones) technology has become one of the most important service delivery inventions these days. Equipped with sensors and cameras, these technologies can perform much on-demand critical application ranging from military and environmental to rescue operations. These UAVs devices, sometimes tiny, that can replace human and manned aircraft in several tasks, have been utilized to perform various types of services and applications more efficiently. However, the deployment side of such emerging technology is still facing many issues and challenges. Using multi-drones or swarm of drones, together to accomplish one operation is one of these recent challenges. Such a system requires a high level of delicacy and cooperation to achieve the required autonomy and reduce human interaction as possible. Communication is one of the biggest challenges in these systems, since the devices should keep exchanging various types of messages with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, a collaborative autonomous system of swarm drones based on deep learning has been proposed and a testbed of cooperative UAVs' mission to validate the performance of the dedicated QoS communication system using Paparazzi drones The proposed system is aware of the drones' requirements in term of QoS and able to meet with their dynamic demands. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The farm controller emphasises computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. The controller combines particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with a turbulence intensity–based Jensen wake model (TI–JM) for exploiting the benefits of either curtailing upstream turbines using coefficient of power (C                             P                             ) or deflecting wakes by applying yaw-offsets for maximising net farm production. Firstly, TI–JM is evaluated using convention control benchmarking WindPRO and real time SCADA data from three operating wind farms. Then the optimised strategies are evaluated using simulations based on TI–JM and PSO. The innovative control strategies can optimise a medium size wind farm, Lillgrund consisting of 48 wind turbines, requiring less than 50 s for a single simulation, increasing farm efficiency up to a maximum of 6% in full wake conditions.                          © 2019 by the authors.},

We utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open source software to create a low-cost accessible platform for the potential use in commercial and research applications. The system is scalable, with the capability of swarm formation in both static and dynamic configurations using real-time path planning and optimized target assignment. The group of UAVs used in this study consists of multiple quadcopters, each equipped with an on-board computer, a flight controller, and COTS telemetry and GPS modules. Commands are sent to the swarm via a ground station. The ground station and UAVs communicate via a WiFi datalink. The system has demonstrated path-planning with collision avoidance capabilities through simulations. This study shows via simulation and partially through experimentation that swarm autonomy can be implemented effectively and cost-efficiently. This creates an ease of access for the use of a swarm of UAVs for a variety of applications including 3D mapping, and search and rescue across a variety of terrains with increasing difficulty. By integrating other sensors and instruments, this swarm can be used to measure a variety of parameters, locating targets and creating formations around them to best study the targets in areas where ground navigation and viewpoints are non-optimal. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent times, airborne Base Station (BS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) mounted Evolved Node B (UeNBs) are used to provide broadband services, and rescue responses in emergency and natural disaster scenarios. Most of the prior studies on airborne BS assume outdoor users only and consider their position coordinates in a two-dimensional (2-D) plane considering only Euclidean distance based pathloss. However in urban natural disaster scenarios such as flooding or cyclone, users are trapped inside single or multi-storey buildings; user positions are in three-dimensional (3-D) plane. Reliable communication and rescue operations in such situation is possible if pathloss characteristics for both, user to UeNB (uplink) and vice versa (downlink), are known a-priori. Since pathloss in above scenarios is a combination of indoor and outdoor component, it becomes a challenge to adopt appropriate model which can be used during communications. In this paper, we have studied several state-of-The-Art pathloss models applicable in the above scenarios and compared their performances. We have also studied the impact of indoor and outdoor environments on the uplink and downlink pathloss models. Our extensive simulation results give a full fledged insight to uplink and downlink channel characteristics of UAV based wireless emergency communication system. From our extensive studies and simulations, we have learnt that Winner II model [1] with additional indoor blockage component provides the best pathloss model for an urban emergency scenario. Furthermore, we have also analyzed the impact of different topological parameters such as UeNB hovering altitude, building heights, indoor and outdoor distance of users, etc., on the pathloss characteristics. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide remote data collection services with quality of service guarantees. The typical application fields include geographic information systems, such as topological survey and natural disasters and hazards monitoring. In the bad geographic environment, wireless communication performance of UAVs cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the efficiency of remote data collection cannot be guaranteed. This paper proposes a collaborative framework of UAVs and fog computing for remote data collection. Our goal is to maximize the revenue of UAVs with the support of fog computing, so we need to find the optimal computation resources allocation and task assignment scheme. This is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The block coordinate descent method is used to solve this problem, which allows the original problem to be divided into the optimal task assignment sub-problem and the optimal computation resource allocation sub-problem. The greedy algorithm, heuristic algorithm and brute force algorithm are proposed to solve the optimal task assignment sub-problem. The convex optimization analysis method is used to solve the optimal resource allocation sub-problem. The genetic algorithm is used as a benchmark to compare with the heuristic-based block coordinate descent algorithm. The numerical simulation and network simulator based-simulation results show that the proposed UAV-Fog collaborative data collection problem can be efficiently solved by the block coordinate descent algorithm based on the heuristic strategy. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In agricultural landscape, there are thousands of young wild animals killed every year. Their deaths are caused mostly by agricultural fieldworks during spring harvest. Among the affected animals there are also fawns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), which react to danger by pressing themselves against the ground in order to be protected from predators. There were various methods tested in the past aimed at decreasing roe deer mortality caused by agriculture machinery with varied levels of success. This contribution presents technology that documents the possibility of searching for fawns with a thermal imaging device carried by an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The results are based on field research that estimated the ideal height of flight being ±40 meters above ground. If the climatic conditions are favourable, it is possible to monitor and mark fawn locations using GPS coordinates in an area of about 14 ha in 25 minutes, which is the average flight time of UAV on one battery charge. The thermo-camera is very reliable in finding fawns in early morning hours (4 to 6 a.m.) when there is the highest temperature contrast between the searched object and its surroundings. The main limiting factors are climatic conditions and the short time span in which the thermo-camera can be used. If the basic requirements are met, the rate of successful fawn detection can be even up to 100%. An undisputed advantage of this method is the possibility of involvement of local gamekeepers. Thus the agricultural fieldworks are not interrupted. Copyright 2019 Cukor et al.},

	abstract = {Source positioning based on energy time-inverse focus is a hot subject in the sphere of shallow underground source positioning. Due to the grave wave group aliasing and the complex, irregular geological structure typical of the shallow underground explosion, the reconstruction accuracy of the energy focus is low and thus the recognition of the focus is a difficult task, ultimately leading to a low accuracy of source positioning. To address the above problems, this article proposes a method based on deep learning energy focus recognition, whereby the process of recognizing and positioning the energy focus in an energy field is made equivalent to the end-to-end feature extraction of the energy field-energy focus. The time-variant characteristics of explosive vibration signals are put to use in the construction of an adaptive time window. First, within the time window and by combining cross-correlation and autocorrelation operations, a 3D energy field image sequence in the time-space domain is produced by grouped energy synthesis; second, a densely connected 3DCNN network is built and, through multiple layer span layer splicing, a higher repetitive use is made of the focus point features in the energy field images; third, a spatial pyramid pooling network is used to extract multi-scale features from different focus areas, which helps achieve high-precision focus recognition. Finally, numerical simulations and field tests were conducted. The results demonstrated that compared with the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO)-based energy focus search method, the proposed one is more effectively in recognizing the coordinates of the focus in the energy field, thus allowing high-precision localization of shallow underground sources. This method is of some engineering application value in the field of underground source positioning. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for the inspection of turbine blades has been registering steady progress and is fast becoming a well-established inspection methodology especially at offshore wind farms. A UAV operating in the open field is subject to varying ambient conditions which have an effect on the power required to maintain stable flight. This may have an impact on the flight endurance of the UAV, especially when operating in windy conditions. Simulations are a very useful tool for estimating the impact of such ambient conditions on the performance and flight endurance of a UAV. However, it is extremely difficult to accurately model all the dynamics at play in the open field where flow conditions are highly stochastic. Few open field studies necessary to validate such simulation models have been carried out to date in this regard. In this study, the impact of open field wind conditions on the flight endurance of a hovering UAV is investigated. The test vehicle used in this study is a quadrotor UAV, which was fitted with an array of sensors to monitor power consumption parameters of the propulsion motors whilst the vehicle is hovering at a fixed altitude above the ground. The quadrotor was also fitted with an ultrasonic wind sensor in order to measure the relevant wind parameters that the quadrotor was being subjected to during the hovering study. The test UAV was flown in different ambient conditions to establish the impact on the UAV flight endurance when subjected to different wind speeds. Results from a series of UAV test flights in the open field indicated that the power required by the UAV to maintain hovering flight decreases as the wind speed increases. Copyright © 2019 ASME},

	abstract = {Parcels delivery is the most expensive phase of the distribution logistics. Everyday, several vehicles, usually internal combustion engine vehicles, have to serve a high number of customers spatially distributed in an urban area. Their presence generates several negative externalities, such as, noise, congestion and pollutant emissions. Drones have become a valid alternative to support the delivery process and several big companies, such as, Amazon and DHL, have started to use them for parcels deliveries. On the one hand, drones drastically reduce negative externalities, allowing a more sustainable delivery process. On the other hand, several technical aspects must be carefully taken into account. In particular, they have a limited flight endurance and capacity. In addition, several restrictions related to safety and flight area must be considered. Indeed, not all countries allow the use of drones in the urban area. In this work, we provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis on benefits and drawbacks in using drones in the parcels delivery process. We analyze three different transportation systems with incremental use of drones for the delivery. In particular, we address the problem of delivering parcels without drone, known as vehicle routing problem, the problem in which the deliveries are performed by a fleet of drones starting from the central depot, and a hybrid transportation system where the classical vehicles are equipped with drones. In the latter case, the classical vehicles perform the deliveries and the drones can get in charge some deliveries. The drone takes off from the vehicle, carries out the delivery, and lands to the same vehicle at a randevouz-location. During the drone delivery, the classical vehicle continues its work. The three transportation systems are formalized via mathematical programming models. The solutions obtained by solving the models via a general-purpose solver are compared and insights on the use of drones in the urban area are provided. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Energy supply is an important system that affects the overall efficiency of urban transportation. To improve the system operational efficiency and reduce costs, we formulate and solve a collaborative multidepot petrol station replenishment problem with multicompartments and time window assignment by establishing a mixed-integer linear programming model. The hybrid heuristic algorithm composed of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization is used as a solution, and then the Shapley value method is applied to analyze the profit allocation of each petrol depot under different coalitions. The optimal membership sequence of the cooperation is determined according to the strict monotone path. To analyze and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a regional petrol supply network in Chongqing city in China is investigated. Through cooperation between petrol depots in the supply network, the utilization of customer clustering, time window coordination, and distribution truck sharing can significantly reduce the total operation costs and improve the efficiency of urban transportation energy supply. This approach can provide theoretical support for relevant government departments and enterprises to make optimal decisions. The implementation of the joint distribution of energy can promote the sustainable development of urban transportation.  © 2020 Guangcan Xu et al.},

	abstract = {In remote agricultural areas, electrical energy is usually deficient for pumping water into greenhouses. Photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind generators are considered suitable options for power supply. The reliability of hybrid generation water pumping depends primarily on the number of system components, which should be adapted to the local climatic conditions and crop irrigation schedule. In this study, a universal size optimization model is established to optimize the configuration of a hybrid PV-wind-battery (PWB) generation system. The climatic conditions and crop irrigation schedule are parameterized in the model. Minimization of the annual cost of the hybrid PWB system is the objective function. The constraints include the battery state of charge (SOC) and the power supply reliability, which consists of the loss of power supply (δLPS) and the excess energy (δEX). The numbers of PV panels and batteries, as well as the rated power of the wind generator, are the decision variables. The optimization model of the PWB generation system is solved using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on penalty function. The model is then applied to determine the optimal configuration of a water pumping system for a greenhouse used to grow tomatoes. Measured climatic data are used in the optimization process, which is conducted in the month of maximum irrigation water requirement (August). The optimal results for this greenhouse are two PV panels and two batteries, and the rated power of the wind generator is 375 W. Furthermore, field experiments are performed to validate the optimization model. The field experiment results show that the total output power of the PV panels and wind generator during 15 d are 41.478 kW and 6.235 kW, respectively. The total load power of the pump is 36.965 kW. The field experiments demonstrate that the optimal results are able to meet the power requirements of the water pumping system and the sizing optimization model is appropriate. © 2020 Dan Li et al.},

Firstly, the environmental parameters of RSSI ranging are modified by the least square method to eliminate the influence of various interferences on the measured data. The exponential factor and the modified RSSI value are directly calculated to determine the coordinates of the unknown node. The exponential factor is optimised by an improved quantum particle swarm optimisation algorithm based on the criterion of minimum root mean square error. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the influence of complex environment factors in the positioning process and has the better positioning accuracy than the traditional method, which meets requirements of personnel location precision in underground long-distance roadway.

	abstract = {Swarm robotics is an approach to collective robotics with which it is easily possible to complete the tasks that are difficult to do with single robot. The wireless multiple access network contributes significantly in wireless mobile swarm robotics for communication and networking, especially in disaster scenarios. Since the unpredictable impacts may fail the sensing robots or nodes, causing the loss of valuable data, a coding scheme called the Growth codes is designed to increase data persistence. In the wireless multiple access network, a key requirement of data collection in disaster scenarios is to maintain a high data intermediate recovery rate. In the later period of the Growth codes, the large amount of redundant data in the network affects the efficiency of data collection. In this paper, we design and analyze techniques to reduce the number of redundant data, and propose a sectional configured data collection strategy based on the Growth codes, called the SCGC protocol. Setting cache nodes around the sink to filter the redundant codewords, the sink can collect data faster, ensuring a high data intermediate recovery rate. We also design an information update strategy and some constraints to control node overhead. Through the simulations, we show that the proportion of redundant codewords can be reduced by 10-15%, while the negative impact of these valid codewords is not considered in the Growth codes. We also show that the SCGC protocol can improve the data recovery efficiency without affecting the stability of the network or shortening the network lifetime. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a bi-level planning approach to find an optimal layout for a large-scale wind farm (WF) from economic and reliability perspectives. The upper level of the planning approach is formulated as constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO) to obtain the optimal WF layout, where two conflicting objectives are optimized simultaneously. Two objectives for MOO are i) yearly gross energy production and ii) annual loan repayment (for cable and land area of the WF), where the first objective is maximized and the second objective is minimized. Jensen's wake model is used to calculate the wake effect, and to evaluate the multiple wake effect within a WF, a coordinate-transformation-based approach has been adopted in this study. An efficient hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic algorithm, which is based on nondominated sorting multi-objective particle swarm optimization and improved archive multi-objective simulated annealing, has been proposed to find the optimized WF layout. The superiority of the Pareto front obtained by the proposed algorithm for the large-scale WF layout is supported by its comparison with different powerful and well-established MOO algorithms. In the lower level of the proposed approach, economic and reliability analyses of the solutions (WF layout), obtained in the Pareto front by the proposed hybrid algorithm, have been done. In this context, two performance metrics, a) generation economy index and b) expected wind energy generation (EWEG), have been considered. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to calculate the EWEG considering random failure of both wind turbines and cables in this paper. The most suitable WF layout is selected by trading off between economy and reliability using a fuzzy decision-making approach. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing a vital and sustainable role in many verticals touching different aspects of our lives including civil, public, and military applications. WSNs majorly consist of a few to several sensor nodes, that are connected to each other via wireless communication links and require real-time or delayed data transfer. In this paper, we propose an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled data gathering mechanism for delay-tolerant WSN applications. The objective is to employ a self-trained UAV as a flying mobile unit collecting data from ground sensor nodes spatially distributed in a given geographical area during a predefined period of time. In this approach, two Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, specifically Deep Deterministic Gradient Decent (DDPG) and Q-learning (QL) algorithms, are jointly employed to train the UAV to understand the environment and provide effective scheduling to accomplish its data collection mission. The DDPG is used to autonomously decide the best trajectory to adopt in an obstacle-constrained environment, while the QL is developed to determine the order of nodes to visit such that the data collection time is minimized. The schedule is obtained while considering the limited battery capacity of the flying unit, its need to return the charging station, the time windows of data acquisition, and the priority of certain sensor nodes. Customized reward functions are designed for each RL model and, through numerical simulations, we investigate their training performances. We also analyze the behavior of the autonomous UAV for different selected scenarios and corroborate the ability of the proposed approach in performing effective data collection. A comparison with the deterministic optimal solution is provided to validate the performance of the learning-based approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern models for Public Safety Networks (PSNs) utilize Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) acting as ad-hoc base stations and complementing the Macro Base Station (MBS) to support the ground users' efficient and undisturbed communication. In this paper, we introduce a holistic and realistic framework that dynamically enables the ground users to invest their transmission power in an autonomous manner either in the UAV-based and/or MBS-based communication, while accounting for their Quality of Service (QoS) prerequisites and risk preferences. The UAV-based communication is characterized by limited available bandwidth, but close distance among the users and the UAV, thus resulting in users' low transmission powers and high achievable data rate, if properly utilized. In our work, the UAV's bandwidth is treated as a Common Pool of Resources (CPR), which can be exploited by all the users residing in the disaster area. However, the latter comes at the expense of resource fragility and potential failure from over-exploitation, due to its fully shared nature and excessive competition among the users. In contrast, the MBS due to its inherent characteristics acts as a safe resource, providing a guaranteed perceived satisfaction to the users based on their transmission power investment. Considering ground users' diverse behavioral patterns, when probabilistic uncertainty of the UAV's shared bandwidth is introduced, we model the ground users' power control problem under the principles of Prospect Theory. The formulated resource orchestration problem is solved as a Fragile CPR game and its convergence to a unique Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) point is proven. A distributed low-complexity algorithm that converges to the unique PNE is devised, while the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation. © 2019 IEEE.},

Alike swarming phenomena in animals and insects, these herds of smart robots could perform complicated task when working together. However, doing so needs smart coordination between individual subsystems. In this paper, aerial coordination by a UAV (also known as aerial shepherd) for a group of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is investigated. The problem is separated in two sections. In the first stage, the aerial leader learns how to find a target using both Q-Learning and DQN techniques. In the next step, the optimal path is sent through a communication link to a group of mobile robots for ground coordination. Through simulations, we study the problem in a model-free environment with existence of stochasticity in control input and the environment. Once the target has been localized, the optimal path is sent to ground mobile robots to provide rescue. The obtained results for a primitive environment indicate successful coordination of mobile robots on the ground. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently been used in a wide variety of applications due to their versatility, reduced cost, rapid deployment, among other advantages. Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the most prominent areas for the employment of UAVs in place of a manned mission, especially because of its limitations on the costs, human resources, and mental and perception of the human operators. In this work, a real-time path-planning solution using multiple cooperative UAVs for SAR missions is proposed. The technique of Particle Swarm Optimization is used to solve a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem that aims to perform search in a given area of interest, following the directive of international standards of SAR. A coordinated turn kinematic model for level flight in the presence of wind is included in the MPC. The solution is fully implemented to be embedded in the UAV on-board computer with DUNE, an on-board navigation software. The performance is evaluated using Ardupilot's Software-In-The-Loop with JSBSim flight dynamics model simulations. Results show that, when employing three UAVs, the group reaches 50% Probability of Success 2.35 times faster than when a single UAV is employed.},

	abstract = {Ram Air Turbines (RAT) have been widely studied as auxiliary power units for civil aircraft. However, their use at low Reynolds and low Mach numbers, at which small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usually operate, have not been deeply examined. The versatility of airframe configurations and electrical propulsion systems of UAVs present potential synergies that can be exploited by the implementation of RATs as a secondary power source for increasing the energy supply on emergency situations. The present work aims to design a RAT for small fixed-wing UAV, which is expected to power the telemetry system in such events. For this purpose, both parametric and quasi two-dimensional approaches are utilized in the design process of the RAT. Then, CFD simulation is performed to corroborate the parametric results. Finally, a wind tunnel testing is carried out to validate the models predictions. From the aforesaid assessment techniques, the turbine power coefficient obtained in the wind tunnel testing is used as main reference to measure the feasibility of implementing the RAT technology as a secondary power source. Hence, this parameter was used within an in-house parametric script to evaluate the aircraft performance and the viability of its implementation. From the experimental results, it is observed that the designed RAT provides approximately 5 [w], which can be potentially used to power the telemetry system. Nevertheless, this latter analysis comes from the adaptation of brushless motors as generators, which induces high losses and detriment of the power generated. From the performance analysis, it is noticed that neglecting the additional drag caused by the RAT implementation, the UAV weight increases by 3.5%, which slightly reduces endurance at lower cruise speeds, whilst at higher speeds the RAT power generation overcomes the weight-increment performance-deficit, providing an improvement in endurance. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {The rapid development of renewable energy poses new challenges to grid operation. Owing to deficiencies in peak regulation capability, wind power cannot be fully connected to the grid. As a controllable load, electric vehicle (EV) charging enables the coordinated operation of EV charging, and the wind/thermal power generation system. In order to determine the coordinated operation mechanism of a power system with large-scale EV charging, a new dynamic multi-objective dispatch (DMOD) model of the power system that includes the economy, pollutant discharge, and abandonment volume was established to optimize the output of thermal power units. Here, we report the two-phase optimization strategy we developed to solve this model. In the first phase of the strategy, EV charging load is determined by optimizing user charging, combined with the time-sharing price of electricity, and the charging protocol. In its second phase, an improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (IMOEA) based on a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) method was proposed to determine the coordinated operation of EV charging, and wind/thermal power generation system. A power system with 10 conventional units, and a grid-connected wind farm was simulated, and the analysis verifies the feasibility of the dispatching model and the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm as a solution. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Multiple species and random change in batch order forms has become the core business of Steel Intelligent Production Enterprises, necessitating new requirements for scheduling real-time adaptability and precision in the steel scheduling model. In this paper, a digital twin intelligent agent with cyberspace physical space integration is proposed as the unified driving source. First, an Open Multiple Objective Travelling Salesmen Problem model was established. For constraints such as a minimum rolling unit plan, process specification and a minimum power consumption per ton of steel, the NSGA-II algorithm was used to obtain a Pareto front for these constraints. With the help of appropriate penalty coefficients for the Pareto front, the constraints were defined as 3D-coordinates among cities of the Travelling Salesmen Problem. Combining the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the PSO algorithm was redefined and modified by introducing the metropolis criterion of the SA algorithm twice. This was used to obtain two extremes of the particle swarm, including the individual optimal solution and the global optimal solution to avoid local extrema. A model based on SA-MOPSO was thus obtained. Then, with the help of real-time mapping between the steel production line and the information model, the double-flow digital twin agent was established. This agent can achieve production scheduling model dynamic development and maturation itself. Finally, taking the steel hot rolling production line as a case in point, training and trial application of the model were performed to verify its adaptive development ability. Simulation results show that the algorithm discussed in this paper can solve the problem of hot rolling scheduling and provide support for decision-makers. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The path planning of UAV deals with the process of figuring the most optimal path from the source to the destination and avoiding obstacles on course to avoid collisions in a given environment. This particular problem is classified as an optimisation problem in high dimension and comes under the category of NP-Hard. Due to the usage of UAVs in many domains like the army, communications, security, disaster management, survey mapping etc., the provisioning of time efficiency as well as accuracy is a critical and challenging task in a 3-D environment. Moreover, the ability of the UAVs can be enhanced if there is coordination between them to find the best cost-effective target in a dynamic manner. However, a majority of the solutions reported theoretically are not efficient concerning time efficiency, accuracy and coordination simultaneously for many applications. Drawing motivation from this, the paper gives a novel way of solving the problem of planning of path for UAVs in 3-D while maintaining the coordination for choosing the target. A new algorithm based on Multiverse optimizer (MVO) algorithm is applied to the problem. Munkres algorithm is applied for coordination of UAVs in case of multiple targets. By carrying out the simulations, on three different maps over 50 iterations the results shows that MVO algorithm perform better in the most of the cases for finding optimized path cost with minimum average execution time when compared to meta-heuristics GSO and BBO. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Examples include UAV-based nondestructive health monitoring of civil infrastructures and remote UAV-assisted emergency response. In this paper, we develop a BVLOS control solution for a remote UAV, using a local UAV relay equipped with automatically aligned directional antennas. The use of UAV relay permits flight control signals to be transmitted even if there exists blockages between the remote UAV and its operator. The use of directional antennas extends the UAV control distance to kilometers with high data throughput. Built upon our previously developed aerial communication system using directional antennas (ACDA), we first upgrade the hardware and software to improve the throughput and endurance. We then design and implement a BVLOS control solution which includes a two-way relay communication. In one direction, low-resolution video views from the remote UAV are transmitted through the local UAV relay to help a UAV operator navigate the remote UAV. In the other direction, UAV control signals are relayed through the local UAV and transmitted to the remote UAV for BVLOS operations. The system is verified using simulation studies and field tests. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Walking is a complex process that involves rhythmic movement of lower limb along with the coordination of brain, nerves and muscles. If the coordination is disturbed, gait may be effected or disordered. Therefore, it should be treated effectively and efficiently using assistive devices/exoskeletons. The exoskeletons and assistive devices may be embedded with the linkage and other mechanisms to imitate the behavior of human lower limb. However, these mechanisms are synthesized using the complex conventional procedures. Thus, a new gait-inspired algorithm is proposed in this study for synthesizing a four-bar mechanism for exoskeletons. Methods: This paper presents a design of four-bar linkage for lower limb exoskeleton to support walking. A new gait-inspired algorithm to synthesize four-bar linkage is also proposed which uses two phases of gait, namely, the swing phase and the stance phase, for lower limb exoskeleton. The trajectory is derived for each phase of the gait and is combined with the optimization techniques. The trajectory passes through 10 precision points in each phase giving a total of 20 precision points for one gait cycle. The optimization is performed in two stages. The first stage deals with the minimization of error between the desired and the generated foot trajectories; whereas, the second stage deals with the minimization of error between the desired and generated hip trajectories of the linkage. Besides the gait-inspired four-bar linkage synthesis, a hybrid teaching-learning-particle-swarm-optimization (HTLPSO) technique is also used to solve the problem. Results: A well-established genetic algorithm (GA) and a new hybrid (HTLPSO) algorithm are used to compare the results of the tracking error of the linkage. It is found that the HTLPSO optimization algorithm performs better in comparison to GA for the problem considered here. Finally, a solid model of the proposed design for lower limb exoskeleton is presented. Moreover, the obtained linkage tracks all the prescribed points accurately and the simulation of designed linkage has been demonstrated using stick diagram for one gait cycle. Conclusion: The proposed method has simplified the synthesis procedure to a great extent, and a feasible design is obtained using the optimization algorithm. The mechanism obtained using the proposed method can walk smoothly which is validated through stick diagram. The proposed mechanism can be used for exoskeleton, assistive devices, bipeds etc. Moreover, the proposed method may be extended to six- and eight-bar mechanisms. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Mobile target localization and tracking is an enabling function for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to achieve various missions, such as search and rescue, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and wildlife monitoring. Existing techniques for vision-based geo-localization of mobile targets primarily rely on coordination transformation and Bayesian filtering, which are dictated by image processing algorithms and are subject to the model selected for Bayesian filtering. Also, historical data are usually not well utilized. This work aims to leverage machine learning techniques, in particular, deep neural networks, for accurate and fast mobile target localization and tracking. We conduct data collection in a MATLAB/Simulink simulation environment for proof of concept. Traditional Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are employed to accomplish target geo-localization and location prediction, respectively. For the former, our FFNN approach outperforms a Kalman filter-based approach on the basis of averaged estimation errors. For the latter, our RNN approach shows its consistent performance on location prediction over a large time horizon when compared with both a baseline method and a Kalman-filter-based approach. Overall, our study shows promising results of the comparison between the Neural-Network-based approaches versus a Kalman filter-based approach. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {The paper proposes a fuzzy logic approach for drone capability analysis on disaster risk assessment. In particular, a fuzzy logic model is designed as a hierarchical system with several inputs and one output. The system inputs corresponds to the linguistic variables, describing the of levels of the external and internal input factors, which determine the capability levels of analysed drone in respect to disaster risk assessment. As external input factors are used, for example: disaster type (flood, landslide, wildfire); weather conditions (wind speed, fog, cloud cover); operational area (urban, mountain, plain), etc. As internal input factors are considered the drone characteristics such as drone type, flight performance (stall speed, turn radius, flight endurance), payload capabilities (camera resolution, accuracy, weight, sensors), etc. The fuzzy logic system output gives the level of the drone capability on disaster risk assessment in defined conditions. The model is designed in Matlab computer environment using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. Several computer simulations are carried out to validate the proposed model. The designed fuzzy logic model is part of an information system for disaster risk management using drones, which is under development. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

	abstract = {Camera calibration is an important part of high-precision optical measurement, which is especially difficult in the micro-nano field. Based on the integrated correlation calculation and CCD moiré method, this paper describes the development of a lens calibration technique called the Integrated Colour CCD Moiré Method (ICCM). The CCD moiré fringes, formed by superimposing a periodic optical signal of a specimen grating with a CCD target array or a Bayer filter array, significantly enlarges the deformation modulated by lens distortion and the calibration plate attitude (i.e. the rotation angle relative to the camera coordinate system). To measure lens distortion using CCD moiré, the deformation pattern that is governed by the lens distortion, specimen grating attitude and carrier was used to construct a CCD fringe image. If the constructed CCD fringe image based on the trial lens distortion and rotation angles have a maximum similarity to the captured CCD moiré image, the lens distortion and rotation angles are correctly inversed. Particle swarm optimisation algorithm was selected to search for the true value so that the accuracy and robustness could be improved. Numerical experiments verified that the ICCM method developed in this work can simultaneously inverse the lens distortion, rotation angle and the grating pitch with high precision. The lens distortion of the metallographic microscope has been successfully characterised by the developed method with an 833 nm pitch grating. Simulations and experiments showed that ICCM is an intuitive, accurate, anti-noise and robust distortion calibration method. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement},

	abstract = {Node localization, which is formulated as an unconstrained NP-hard optimization problem, is considered as one of the most significant issues of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Recently, many swarm intelligent algorithms (SIAs) were applied to solve this problem. This study aimed to determine node location with high precision by SIA and presented a new localization algorithm named LMQPDV-hop. In LMQPDV-hop, an improved DV-Hop was employed as an underground mechanism to gather the estimation distance, in which the average hop distance was modified by a defined weight to reduce the distance errors among nodes. Furthermore, an efficient quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO), named LMQPSO, was developed to find the best coordinates of unknown nodes. In LMQPSO, the memetic algorithm (MA) and Lévy flight were introduced into QPSO to enhance the global searching ability and a new fast local search rule was designed to speed up the convergence. Extensive simulations were conducted on different WSN deployment scenarios to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm and the results show that the new algorithm can effectively improve position precision. © 2019 by the authors.

The scheme proposed in the paper provides a network architecture for the scalable solution of UAVs in an urban environment addressing issues of path planning, safety, privacy, and network connectivity.

This plan includes synchronized routing and drone recharging plans utilizing the truck as a mobile recharge point. Two multi-stage strategies for coordination are proposed: a drone-centered strategy and a truck-centered strategy. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of both approaches applied to the scenario of post-disaster assessment in Santa Rosa during 2017 California Wildfires.

A dynamic soaring bird or UAV utilizes the locally accelerating wind to its advantage, extracting sufficient energy from the environment during each trajectory cycle to overcome losses due to induced and parasitic drag. Most analyses and simulations of dynamic soaring trajectories include temporal and spatial gradient models of wind that are most likely to be encountered within the planetary atmosphere and associated boundary layer. Conversely, gradient models of winds that are not possible nor sustainable in nature can be illuminating for developing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms at work in dynamic soaring. This current research seeks to clarify the underlying physics and mechanics of dynamic soaring through the presentation of a steady state scenario and introduction of new dynamic soaring parameters, arriving at novel conclusions regarding accelerating reference frames, leading to the proposed unification of static and dynamic soaring. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {A profitable strand of literature has lately capitalized on the exploitation of the collaborative capabilities of robotic swarms for efficiently undertaking diverse tasks without any human intervention, ranging from the blind exploration of devastated areas after massive disasters to mechanical repairs of industrial machinery in hostile environments, among others. However, most contributions reported to date deal only with robotic missions driven by a single task-related metric to be optimized by the robotic swarm, even though other objectives such as energy consumption may conflict with the imposed goal. In this paper four multi-objective heuristic solvers, namely NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D and SMPSO, are used to command and route a set of robots towards efficiently reconstructing a scene using simple camera sensors and stereo vision in two phases: explore the area and then achieve validated map points. The need for resorting to multi-objective heuristics stems, from the consideration of energy efficiency as a second target of the mission plan. In this regard, by incorporating energy trophallaxis within the swarm, overall autonomy is increased. An environment is arranged in V-REP to shed light on the performance over a realistically emulated physical environment. SMPSO shows better exploration capabilities during the first phase of the mission. However, in the second phase the performance of SMPSO degrades in contrast to NSGA-II and NSGA-III. Moreover, the entire robotic swarm is able to return to the original departure position in all the simulations. The obtained results stimulate further research lines aimed at considering decentralized heuristics for the considered problem. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

Existing household energy management systems cannot offer its users a choice to ensure user comfort (UC) and not provide a sustainable solution in terms of reduced carbon emission. To tackle these problems, this research work proposes a heuristic-based programmable energy management controller (HPEMC) to manage the energy consumption in residential buildings to minimize electricity bills, reduce carbon emissions, maximize UC and reduce the peak-to-average ratio (PAR). We used our proposed hybrid genetic particle swarm optimization (HGPO) algorithm and existing algorithms like a genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), wind-driven optimization algorithm (WDO), bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) to schedule smart appliances optimally to attain our desired objectives. In the proposed model, consumers use solar panels to produce their energy from microgrids. We also perform MATLAB simulations to validate our proposed HGPO-HPEMC (HHPEMC), and results confirm the efficiency and productivity of our proposed HPEMC based strategy. The proposed algorithm reduced the electricity cost by 25.55%, PAR by 36.98%, and carbon emission by 24.02% as compared to the case of without scheduling.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, we have seen an uptrend in the popularity of UAVs driven by the desire to apply these aircraft to areas such as precision farming, infrastructure and environment monitoring, surveillance, surveying and mapping, search and rescue missions, weather forecasting, and more. The traditional approach for small size UAVs is to capture data on the aircraft, stream it to the ground through a high power data-link, process it remotely (potentially off-line), perform analysis, and then relay commands back to the aircraft as needed. Given the finite energy resources found onboard an aircraft (battery or fuel), traditional designs greatly limit aircraft endurance since significant power is required for propulsion, actuation, and the continuous transmission of visual data. All the mentioned application scenarios would benefit by carrying a high performance embedded computer system to minimize the need for data transmission. A major technical hurdle to overcome is that of drastically reducing the overall power consumption of these UAVs so they can be powered by solar arrays, and for long periods of time. This paper describes an integrated power model for a solar-powered, computationally-intensive unmanned aircraft that includes power models for solar generation, aircraft propulsion, and avionics. These power consumption and generation models are described, derived, and integrated into a cohesive system-wide aircraft power model that is presented in the form of a systemic flow diagram. Power balance expressions are also imposed based on temporal and physical constraints. Compared to works in the existing literature, the integrated model presented follows a holistic approach for UAV modeling that encompasses aircraft, propulsion, and solar models under realistic assumptions. Additionally, in order to enable high fidelity estimation while requiring minimal computation power, the model was developed to estimate the power consumption and generation based on flight path state, without needing precise aerodynamic measurements, e.g. angle-of-attack. Several of the methods have already been evaluated by means of ground and flight testing, as well as simulation, and showed errors ranging from negligible to approximately 5%. The motivation behind this work is the development of computationally-intensive, long-endurance solar-powered unmanned aircraft, the UIUC Solar Flyer, which will have continuous daylight ability to acquire and process high resolution visible and infrared imagery. Therefore, having a holistic integrated power model that can encompass power generation and consumption allows further aircraft and mission design and optimization can be performed. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This work proposes method to solve the Agricultural Plant Protection UAV scheduling problem in practice such as pesticide spraying, flying and charging. At first, tasks are assigned to UAVs, then schedules are planned for UAVs. To find a near optimal schedule quickly, our method is incorporated with Dragonfly Algorithm.

	abstract = {The fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) is expected to provide diverse and stringent improvements such as greater connectivity, bandwidth, throughput, availability, improved coverage, and lower latency. Considering this, drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are perfect examples of existing technology that can take advantage of the capabilities provided by 5G technology. In particular, UAVs are expected to be an important component of 5G networks implementations and support different communication requirements and applications. UAVs working together with 5G can potentially facilitate the deployment of standalone or complementary communications infrastructures, and, due to its rapid deployment, these solutions are suitable candidates to provide network services in emergency scenarios, natural disasters, and search and rescue missions. An important consideration in the deployment of a programmable drone fleet is to guarantee the reliability and performance of the services through consistent monitoring, control, and management scheme. In this regard, the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) paradigm, a key technology within the 5G ecosystem, can be used to perform automation, management, and orchestration tasks. In addition, to ensure the coordination and reliability in the communications systems, considering that the UAVs have a finite lifetime and that eventually they must be replaced, a scheduling scheme is needed to guarantee the availability of services and efficient resource utilization. To this end, in this paper is presented an UAV scheduling scheme which leverages the potential offered by NFV. The proposed strategy, based on a brute-force search combinatorial algorithm, allows obtaining the optimal scheduling of UAVs in time, in order to efficiently deploy network services. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed strategy, by providing the number of drones needed to meet certain levels of service availability. Furthermore, the strategy allows knowing the sequence of replacement of UAVs to ensure the optimal resource utilization. © 2019 Christian Tipantuña et al.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the power management system (PMS) that relies on optimal power planning and maximum energy efficiency in dynamic positioning (DP) drilling vessel. Nowadays, it is becoming an improving demand for higher precision and decreases ship motion induced by environmental disturbance such as wind, waves, and sea current, which leads to the use of power generation more efficient. According to this, an efficient strategy solution and schedule have increased significantly for power management of diesel generator (DG) units on marine vessels as an independent microgrid to the utility grid. Thus, the power management system (PMS) of vessels is proposed to monitor and prevent the blackout by using the model predictive controller (MPC) based on optimal control method in order to estimate the future power demand in the hostile environment. Due to nonlinear characteristics of diesel generators, such as power ramp rate limits and non-smooth cost functions, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem for a dynamic system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve ED operation problems more efficiently while meeting DGs constraints. © 2019 IEEE.},

Some of the most important are the smart farming and precision agriculture domains. Thanks to the feasibility and the versatility of these systems it is possible to accomplish several jobs with the same device. In this application context, we propose a new system composed of a master smart station, some slave satellite stations and UAV fleet. It is developed on the basis of the M2M communication paradigm where devices cooperate between them in an autonomous way to perform assigned tasks. In particular, we designed a smart station which is responsible for managing fleet by assigning tasks and scheduling activities. Moreover, it is also responsible for managing satellite stations for assisting the fleet during its operations. In particular, these stations stock energy during their idle state. We propose an all-in-one hardware solution based on energy harvesting approaches all implemented in the smart stations. Moreover, they supply energy in an on-demand way to the UAV devices which are asking for recharge during their missions. Finally, we designed a customized protocol in an M2M environment based on the MQTT framework to ensure communication between devices and to coordinate operations. © 2019 SPIE.

In this paper, the trajectory sensitivity of time-varying parameters of the equivalent model is analyzed. Then the non-time- varying parameters of the equivalent model are fixed as aggregated values, while the time-varying parameters are identified using the genetic learning particle swarm optimization based on phasor measurement unit data at the point of interconnection. The robustness and adaptability of the equivalent model under different scenarios are analyzed. The simulation results using the Western Electricity Coordinating Council benchmark test system show that the global searching capability to find the optimal point of the proposed method is higher than canonical particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm by 2 orders. Further, the biggest mismatch between the identification results of the proposed method and the true values is within 10% for parameters with high sensitivity which is much better than previous work. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the control design problem for the quadrotor UAV is quite difficult in the indoor environment due to the weak GPS signal. Based on Ultra Wide Band (UWB), the related positioning issues can be solved of UAV through base station with known coordinate position and equipment with location tag, but it is difficult to meet the high-precision operation requirements. In this paper, an indoor positioning design method combined with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and UWB positioning technology is proposed, which can effectively suppress the error accumulation of the IMU and further improve the positioning accuracy. Moreover, the system architecture for a class of quadrotor UAV is designed. The multisensor fusion technology based on unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to avoid neglecting the high-order terms of the nonlinear observation equations of UWB and IMU, which can effectively improve the accuracy of solving the nonlinear equations. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is designed to verify the effectiveness of the indoor positioning method and improve the positioning accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system.

To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations.

	abstract = {The continuous evolution of commercial Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is fuelling a rapid advancement in the fields of network edge-communication applications for smart agriculture, smart traffic management, and border security. A common problem in UAS (a.k.a. drone systems) research and development is the cost related to deploying and running realistic testbeds. Due to the constraints in safe operation, handling limited energy resources, and government regulation restrictions, UAS testbed building is time-consuming and not easily configurable for high-scale experiments. In addition, experimenters have a hard time creating repeatable and reproducible experiments to test major hypotheses. In this paper, we present a design for performing tracebased NS-3 simulations that can be helpful for realistic UAS simulation experiments. We run experiments with real-world UAS traces including various mobility models, geospatial link information and video analytics measurements. Our experiments assume a hierarchical UAS platform with low-cost/high-cost drones co-operating using a geo-location service in order to provide a € common operating picture' for decision makers. We implement a synergized drone and network simulator that features three main modules: (i) learning-based optimal scheme selection module, (ii) application environment monitoring module, and (iii) trace-based simulation and visualization module. Simulations generated from our implementation have the ability to integrate di † erent drone configurations, wireless communication links (air-to-air; air-to-ground), as well as mobility routing protocols. Our approach is beneficial to evaluate network-edge orchestration algorithms pertaining to e.g., management of energy consumption, video analytics performance, and networking protocols configuration. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

	abstract = {High-power lithium-ion battery packs are widely used in large and medium-sized unmanned aerial vehicles and other fields, but there is a safety hazard problem with the application that needs to be solved. The generation mechanism and prevention measurement research is carried out on the battery management system for the unmanned aerial vehicles and the lithium-ion battery state monitoring. According to the group equivalent modeling demand of the battery packs, a new idea of compound equivalent circuit modeling is proposed and the model constructed to realize the accurate description of the working characteristics. In order to realize the high-precision state prediction, the improved unscented Kalman feedback correction mechanism is introduced, in which the simplified particle transforming is introduced and the voltage change rate is calculated to construct a new endurance prediction model. Considering the influence of the consistency difference between battery cells, a novel equilibrium state evaluation idea is applied, the calculation results of which are embedded in the equivalent modeling and iterative calculation to improve the prediction accuracy. The model parameters are identified by the Hybrid Pulse Power Characteristic test, in which the conclusion is that the mean value of the ohm internal resistance is 20.68 mΩ. The average internal resistance is 1.36 mΩ, and the mean capacitance value is 47747.9F. The state of charge prediction error is less than 2%, which provides a feasible way for the equivalent modeling, battery management system design and practical application of pack working lithium-ion batteries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This chapter presents first concepts for the improved validation of automated farming solutions. Within the ENABLE-S3 ECSEL JU project, the farming use case team presents developments within the agricultural domain, that can in the future improve the life and working environment of farmers. Applications such as autonomous driving of farming vehicles equipped with sensors and drones supporting hyperspectral cameras, validated by newly defined testing systems like co-simulation of farming vehicles, model-based simulation of farming systems and verification and testing of in-vehicle communication are advances developed during the project. As agricultural activities are very dependent on environmental parameters (e.g. weather, harvest ripeness) and the availability of the actual vehicles (which is very often not the case), the use case team opted for realistic simulators for first validation approaches. In this work, multiple simulators are introduced that combine many agricultural concepts including the simulation of the farming systems (i.e. harvester, tractors and drones). Additionally, introducing autonomy into vehicles requires deterministic in-vehicle communication and the guarantee that messages arrive timely. Validation of in-vehicle communication is introduced to showcase the applicability of the technology. The overall goal of the work performed in this use case is to reduce the testing costs and time of farming scenarios, be less dependent on many factors (like crop availability) and be able to perform continuous validation and verification of the farming systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {On August 16, 2014, an intense seismic swarm started below the eastern part of Bárðarbunga caldera in the north-western part of Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland, marking the onset of a major rifting event. The intense seismicity, corroborated by a complicated deformation pattern, migrated away from the Bárðarbunga caldera for >45 km, until a small effusive eruption started in Holuhraun, outside of the ice cap, on August 29 which lasted a few hours. On August 31 a second, more intense, eruption started. It lasted 180 days and is the largest effusive eruption in Iceland since the Laki event in 1783–1784. A lava field covered about 84 km2 in the middle of the highlands with a bulk volume of ~1.44 km3. Although the potential danger of ice melting and subsequent flooding coupled with tephra fallout was the main concern at the beginning of the crisis, the main associated hazard turned out to be an abundant and constant release of volcanic gases that polluted the country threatening human health and the environment for several months. Very little (or almost no) ash was produced. The impact of the Holuhraun eruption outside of Iceland was minor if compared with what happened in 2010 when Eyjafjallajökull erupted. However, on three occasions the dense gas cloud released by the fissure eruption reached some European countries where unusually high SO2 concentrations were measured at ground level. Managing and living with such a prolonged effusive event was a major effort for the Icelandic scientific community and civil protection authorities and it significantly affected the local population in the northern and eastern parts of the country. This paper retraces the main events that accompanied the volcanic crisis at Bárðarbunga and focuses on the scientific and operative response provided throughout its duration. Particular attention is given to the direct links between the observed phenomena, monitoring effort, hazard assessment and concrete actions taken by the authorities in charge of risk and mitigation assessment. The different roles of the involved institutions are clarified, and the wide and collaborative response on a national basis is explained. A major finding of this post-event analysis is that a strong internal collaboration between the scientific community and operative institutions is the basic element for proper crisis management. Iceland has established protocols that, while imperfect, ensured a well-coordinated response to the Holuhraun eruption and the preceding unrest, and will continue to provide a prompt and effective response for future events. Important realizations, including the need for a proper ground-based alert level system, have been raised and they will be a matter for further development. © 2019},

	abstract = {With the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is an intense pressure on resource and performance optimization leveraging on existing technologies, such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), edge computing, and container orchestration. Industry 4.0 emphasizes the importance of lean and efficient operations for sustainable manufacturing. Achieving this goal would require engineers to consider all layers of the system, from hardware to software, and optimizing for resource efficiency at all levels. This emphasizes the need for container-based virtualization tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, offering Platform as a Service (PaaS), while simultaneously leveraging on edge technologies to reduce related latencies. For network management, SDN is poised to offer a cost-effective and dynamic scalability solution by customizing packet handling for various edge applications and services. In this paper, we investigate the energy and latency trade-offs involved in combining these technologies for industrial applications. As a use case, we emulate a 3D-drone-based monitoring system aimed at providing real-time visual monitoring of industrial automation. We compare a native implementation to a containerized implementation where video processing is orchestrated while streaming is handled by an external UE representing the IIoT device. We compare these two scenarios for energy utilization, latency, and responsiveness. Our test results show that only roughly 16 percent of the total power consumption happens on the mobile node when orchestrated. Virtualization adds up about 4.5 percent of the total power consumption while the latency difference between the two approaches becomes negligible after the streaming session is initialized. CCBY},

Currently, the payload and endurance are limited by the battery technology for electric powered drones. In addition, charging or replacing the batteries may not be a practical solution at the field that requires near continuous operation. In this paper, a procedure to optimize the power system of an electric hybrid drone that consists of an internal combustion engine, a generator, a battery, and electric motors is presented. The example drone for crop dusting is sized for easy transportation with a maximum takeoff weight of 200 kg. The two main rotors that are mechanically connected to the internal combustion engine provides most of the lift. The drone is controled by four electric motors that are driven by the generator. By analyzing the flow of the energy, a methodology to select the optimum propeller and motor among the commercially available models is described. Then, a procedure of finding the optimum operational condition along with the proper gear reduction ratios for the internal combustion engine based on the test data is presented. © 2019 The Korean Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences.},

	abstract = {Traffic light-free intersection control is envisioned to alleviate congestion and manage vehicles intelligently. With the help of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and edge computing (EC), vehicles are instructed to cross the intersection with high vehicle safety and traffic efficiency without traffic lights. However, unstable channel conditions can lead to the reduction of traveling safety. In this paper, we propose a robust autonomous intersection control (AIC) approach with global optimization scheduling, which protects connected autonomous vehicles from collision under any channel conditions while achieving decent traffic efficiency. In particular, we propose an AIC model that gives vehicles certain autonomy under centralized control to ensure the traveling safety in case of some emergencies. By conducting an interference graph, we simplify the AIC problem as a weighted maximal clique problem with restriction. To improve the fairness and efficiency in terms of vehicle passage, multiple factors such as travel delay, traffic of the current lane and passengers' desired speed are considered. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to search the solution space. For further optimization, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, achieving a near-optimal result with adjustable overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and conduct a comparative performance evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The availability of effective communications in post-disaster scenarios is key to implement emergency networks that enable the sharing of critical information and support the coordination of the emergency response. To deliver those levels of QoS suitable to these applications, it is vital to exploit the multiple communication opportunities made available by the progressive deployment of the 5G and Smart City paradigms, ranging from ad-hoc networks among smartphones and surviving IoT devices, to cellular networks but also drone-based and vehicle-based wireless access networks. Therefore, the user device should be able to opportunistically select the most convenient among them to satisfy the demands for QoS imposed by the applications and also minimize the power consumption. The driving idea of this paper is to leverage non-cooperative game theory to design such an opportunistic user association strategy in a post-disaster scenario using UAV ad-hoc networks. The adaptive game-theoretic scheme allows increasing of the QoS of the communication means by lowering the loss rate and also keeps moderate the energy consumption. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Rechargeable sensors together with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are collaboratively employed for fulfilling periodic coverage tasks. However, traditional coverage solutions are normally based on static deployment of sensors and not suitable for such coverage requirements. In this paper, we propose a new concept of coverage problem named Period-Area Coverage (PAC) which requires data of the overall area must be collected periodically. We focus on maximizing the energy efficiency of UAVs and propose two heuristic scheduling schemes to balance energy cost. Moreover, we adopt adjustable sensing range to further promote efficiency and develop a charging re-allocation mechanism for UAVs.

The wind power has been integrated into the electric grid due to its irregularity and uncertainty. Therefore, endeavors ought to be made in predicting the wind behavior and its relating electric generation. The wind power forecasting is required to cope with the stated challenges. For short term wind power forecasting, a hybrid intelligent technique is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology is the hybridization of wavelet transform (WT) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The average hourly time series data of one year has been taken from the wind park located at Agar in USA, which is first decomposed and then applied to the optimized ANFIS model using particle swarm optimization to predict the wind power output.

Aiming at the large degree of modern simplification, low prediction accuracy, poor authenticity and reliability of data sample in traditional methods, a trajectory prediction method based on HPSO-TPFENN neural network is established by combining with the characteristics of trajectory with time continuity. The time profit factor was introduced into the target function of Elman neural network, and the parameters of improved Elman neural network are optimized by using the hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm (HPSO), and the HPSO-TPFENN neural network was constructed. An independent prediction method of three-dimensional coordinates is firstly proposed, and the trajectory prediction data sample including course angle and pitch angle is constructed by using true combat data selected in the air combat maneuvering instrument (ACMI), and the trajectory prediction model based on HPSO-TPFENN neural network is established. The precision and real-time performance of trajectory prediction model are analyzed through the simulation experiment, and the results show that the relative error in different direction is below 1%, and it takes about 42ms approximately to complete 595 consecutive prediction, indicating that the present model can accurately and quickly predict the trajectory of the target aircraft. © 2019 Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University.},

The main parameters of the tai-sitter, wingspan, wing root, wing slightly, sweep angle, winglet slightly, winglet slightly longer, winglet height, winglet sweep angle, winglet thickness and winglet length were investigated to study the relationship between the structural parameters and the endurance time. The 3D model of tail-sitter and its outflow field were established with CATIA and ANSYS software. The outflow field of tail-sitter was simulated by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software with model under 130 different structural parameter combinations. The feature factors of aerodynamic coefficients and weight coefficients were screened with the analysis of variance. Relationship between characteristic structural parameters and endurance time was established with the accuracy of 0.97. Four models of aircraft were processed by 3D printing technology for wind tunnel test. The aerodynamic coefficients of the aircrafts in cruise state were measured. The relative error between aerodynamic coefficient numerical simulation and wind tunnel test results was less than 14%. Simulation results were verified by measuring the endurance time in the fixed-point hover of the two produced UAV samples. The result showed that the relative error was less than 15%, and the model can be used to optimize the design of structural parameters for the agricultural VTOL tail-sitter UAV. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

	abstract = {Along with natural disasters, the destruction of communication infrastructures leads to the congestion or failure of communication networks. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are with a high flexibility, can be employed as temporary base stations to establish emergency networks. To relieve the backhaul burden of UAVs, some imperative contents can be cached by terrestrial cache-enabled rescuers (CERs) and provide for victims with device-to-device (D2D) transmissions. To support the effectiveness and timeliness of emergency communication, the delay-bounded quality-of-service (QoS) requirement and network throughput are desired to be comprehensively considered, which imposes a new challenge for caching placement and CER deployment. In this paper, we focus on joint caching placement and CER deployment to maximize the effective capacity subject to delay-bounded QoS requirement. The overall non-convex problem is transformed into the caching placement and the CER deployment sub-problems. Then, we develop the QoS-aware caching placement scheme with fixed CER deployment density and obtain the QoS-aware CER deployment density with fixed caching placement. Based on the block-coordinate descent method, we also propose the joint caching placement and CER deployment scheme, which can not only effectively enhance average effective capacity but also guarantee the delay-bounded QoS requirement. Also, numerical simulations are con-ducted to show the performances of the proposed schemes. © 2020, Posts and Telecom Press Co Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Improving the efficiency of precision farming technologies requires the use of intelligent adaptive modes of information collection based on adaptive ad-hoc networks, including unmanned aerial vehicles. In this regard, it is rele-vant to develop a methodology for multi-level coordination of design solutions in the construction of a unified network for data collection and processing (UNDCP) of geo-ecological monitoring, which has a high technical and economic efficiency. The structure of spatial and temporal processing of heterogeneous data in the geodynamic monitoring system has been developed, which increases the efficiency of the geo-ecological monitoring network by consistently applying the solution in the process of its design. A three-stage model of the Markov decision-making process in the design of a telecommunications environment for geo-ecological monitoring is considered. This model includes the stages of choos-ing the location of base stations, radio interface parameters, and data collection and processing protocol. When carrying out a simulation at the second stage was carried out selection of modulation method and error-correcting coding in the radio channel at the third stage – resending a messageusing S-Aloha. Simulation results clearly illustrate the higher performance of the UNDCP, taking into account the decomposition of the optimization process by levels (compared to a complete search of solutions). The implementation of the proposed multi-level coordination of design solutions in the construction of a geo-ecological monitoring network allowed to eliminate computational difficulties in the choice of options for building a large-scale UNDCP. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

It is crucial to minimize the costs giving priority for sustainable resources use instead of purchasing from the national grid. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is examined by the IEEE 14 bus system containing microgrids (MGs) integrated with RESs in the form of VPP. Real load demand recorded is used to model and simulate the test case studies of the system for 24 h in Perlis, Malaysia. Moreover, weather data collected from the Malaysian Meteorological Department such as wind, solar, fuel, and battery status data are used in the BPSO to find the best ON and OFF schedules. The results found that the developed BPSO algorithm is robust in reducing energy consumption and emissions of the VPP. This study contributes to the development of an optimization algorithm for an optimal scheduling controller of MG integrated VPP in order to reduce carbon emissions and manage sustainable energy. Finally, a comparative analysis of the optimal algorithms over conventional justifies the use of RESs integration and validates the developed BPSO for sustainable energy management and emissions reduction. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the flexibility in 3-D space and high probability of line-of-sight (LoS) in air-to-ground communications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as means to support energy-efficient data collection. However, in emergency applications, the mission completion time should be main concerns. In this article, we propose a UAV-aided data collection design to gather data from a number of ground users (GUs). The objective is to optimize the UAV's trajectory, altitude, velocity, and data links with GUs to minimize the total mission time. However, the difficulty lies in that the formulated time minimization problem has mutual effect with trajectory variables. To tackle this issue, we first transform the original problem equivalently to the trajectory length problem and then decompose the problem into three subproblems: 1) altitude optimization; 2) trajectory optimization; and 3) velocity and link scheduling optimization. In the altitude optimization, the aim is to maximize the transmission region of GUs which can benefit trajectory designing; then, in the trajectory optimization, we propose a segment-based trajectory optimization algorithm (STOA) to avoid repeat travel; besides, we also propose a group-based trajectory optimization algorithm (GTOA) in large-scale high-density GU deployment to relieve massive computation introduced by STOA. Then, the velocity and link scheduling optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) is employed to solve it. Simulations show that both STOA and GTOA achieve shorter trajectory compared with the existing algorithm and GTOA has less computational complexity; besides, the proposed time minimization design is valid by comparing to the benchmark scheme. © 2014 IEEE.},

Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the most prominent areas for the employment of UAVs in place of a manned mission, especially because of its limitations on the costs, human resources, and mental and perception of the human operators. In this work, a real-time path-planning solution using multiple cooperative UAVs for SAR missions is proposed. The technique of Particle Swarm Optimization is used to solve a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem that aims to perform search in a given area of interest, following the directive of international standards of SAR. A coordinated turn kinematic model for level flight in the presence of wind is included in the MPC. The solution is fully implemented to be embedded in the UAV on-board computer with DUNE, an on-board navigation software. The performance is evaluated using Ardupilot’s Software-In-The-Loop with JSBSim flight dynamics model simulations. Results show that, when employing three UAVs, the group reaches 50% Probability of Success 2.35 times faster than when a single UAV is employed. © 2019 by the authors.

The proposed emergency communication infrastructure includes a hovering helicopter and a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to provide communication service for GTs. Different from the existed work, an adaptive speed cruise model is proposed for the UAV depending on distribution density of GTs. Then, an efficient dynamic channel resource schedule method is proposed for system with limited channel resource. The channel access probability is formed as non convex optimization problem. The original non-convex optimization problem is transferred into a convex problem by analyzing objective function. An interior-point method is adopted to solve this problem. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the model by optimizing the UAV speed in different regions. The results show that the proposed new scheme outperforms the one with constant cruise speed for UAV and static scheduling for channel resource allocation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Small Cells (SCs) installed on board of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a promising solution to provide wireless coverage to users escaping from an area affected by a disaster event. In this paper, we target the problem of maximizing the throughput over a set of areas in a disaster-affected territory. More in depth, we take into account: i) the limited capacity of the UAV-SC battery, ii) the maximum throughput that can be managed by each UAV-SC (due to backhauling/processing constraints), iii) the number of UAV-SCs that can simultaneously cover the same area. We then formulate the Maximum Throughput with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MT-UAV) problem, which is able to schedule the UAV-SC missions over a set of Time Slots (TSs) to maximize the total area throughput. Results, obtained over a realistic scenario, reveal that the total throughput is clearly impacted by the UAV-SC backhauling/processing constraints, rather than by the number of UAV-SCs providing coverage over the same area. Moreover, we analyze the UAV-SC missions selected by MT-UAV, showing that a typical mission is performed over multiple consecutive TSs. Therefore, we claim that the UAV-SC battery capacity is fundamental to guarantee sufficiently long missions and consequently to ensure the throughput requirements over multiple TSs. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Emerging technology like civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has the potential to exert an impact on agriculture production and crop damages assessment. Securing sustainability in agriculture requires accountability and responsibility of the actors engaged in the deployment of the civilian UAV due to associated deployment risks and unintended consequences. UAV technology has the potential to replace remote sensing technologies like satellite imageries and piloted aircraft used in the crop insurance business. The governance of deployment of UAV technology in India is a complex challenge when a well-developed regulatory system is not in place and diverse actors involved in the deployment and operation of civilian UAV for agricultural applications. Therefore, two main questions, how UAV innovations can lead to sustainability in Indian agriculture and how are the issues of governance of civil UAV innovations in crop insurance applications addressed, are dealt with. The responsible innovation approach is adopted as a theoretical framework. The exploratory and qualitative study used in-depth interviews, and the interviewees were selected through snowball sampling technique. The results suggest that in the governance of emerging technologies like UAV certain values such as trust, transparency, safety, autonomy, and environmental friendliness assumed high significance. Findings also suggest that UAV has the risk-taking ability in adverse weather condition. The UAV technology also creates values (social, economic and environmental) for deployment in the crop insurance business in India. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The objective is to assign tasks to robots while optimizing a given criterion. This problem is known to be \mathcal {NP} -hard even with small numbers of robots and tasks. The field of survivors' search and rescue is adopted: i.e. some Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are used to rescue a number of survivors. We choose this problem, given its importance in everyday life: (a) survivors are the tasks; (b) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are the robots; and (c) the objective is to rescue the maximum number of survivors while minimizing the makespan (time elapsed between rescuing the first and last survivors) and traveled distances. The approach is composed of two phases: inclusion and consensus. During the inclusion phase, each Unmanned Aerial Vehicle builds a bundle of survivors using the Ant Colony System. During the consensus phase, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles resolve conflicts in their bundles of survivors (i.e. a survivor is being chosen by more than two Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), using an adequate coordination mechanism. The approach is implemented using Java programming language and JADE multi-agent Framework. The performance of our approach is compared to five state-of-the-art multi-robot task allocation solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms these solutions, in terms of: (i) makespans; (ii) traveled distances; and (iii) exchanged messages. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the stability issues of the Double Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind farm in the power system with variable wind speed in strong and weak grid. With the intermittent generation of the wind power, it experiences instability and malfunction. The nature of Electromechanical Modes of Oscillations (EMOs) for DFIG incorporated into the multi-machine system under various conditions is explored considering system uncertainties. In this paper, the impact of Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and Static Series Synchronous Compensator (SSSC) on the stability of wind power system is analyzed by utilizing modified IEEE 14-bus test system. The rotor speed deviation is the objective function for particle swarm optimization and is formulated based on the transient and small signal stability. The transient and small signal stability investigations are performed by using time domain simulation and eigenvalue analysis respectively. The sensitivity analysis is carried out with degree of compensation of SSSC and coefficient of damping gain of PSS as sensitivity parameter. The performance of the modified test system is examined for transient and small signal stability for DFIG based wind farm for variable wind speed and grid strength considering different combinations of PSS and SSSC. From the results, it is noticed that oscillations in the system are minimized, damping, transient and small signal stability are enhanced and also the capability of synchronous generator and DFIG under extreme disturbance is intensified by optimization the coordinated controllers’ parameters. The analyses also show that damping ratio is improved for most of the EMOs. Sensitivity analysis identifies EMOs that have detrimental and beneficial impacts on the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Targets in such rescue missions can be fire, mines, human victims, or dangerous material that the robots have to handle. In these scenarios, some cooperation among the robots is required for accomplishing the mission. This paper focuses on the application of different bio-inspired metaheuristics for the coordination of a swarm of mobile robots that have to explore an unknown area in order to rescue and handle cooperatively some distributed targets. This problem is formulated by first defining an optimization model and then considering two sub-problems: exploration and recruiting. Firstly, the environment is incrementally explored by robots using a modified version of ant colony optimization. Then, when a robot detects a target, a recruiting mechanism is carried out to recruit a certain number of robots to deal with the found target together. For this latter purpose, we have proposed and compared three approaches based on three different bio-inspired algorithms (Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Artificial Bee Algorithm). A computational study and extensive simulations have been carried out to assess the behavior of the proposed approaches and to analyze their performance in terms of total energy consumed by the robots to complete the mission. Simulation results indicate that the firefly-based strategy usually provides superior performance and can reduce the wastage of energy, especially in complex scenarios. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal scheduling framework for autonomous UAVs using reinforcement learning. The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints. A comparison with an optimal deterministic solution is also provided to validate the performance of the learning-based solution. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This study provides the optimized selection of flight heading, take-off and landing location, turning mode and flight point coordinate solution for ASUAV before autonomous flight operation under the condition of whole-area coverage. Turning mode strategy of ASUAV was studied based on autonomous flight at constant speed under constraint of the minimum turning radius. The path planning method under arbitrary convex polygons was analyzed and designed. An integerized route planning scheme was proposed based on the slight change of working width. Path planning and optimal selection under the condition of whole region-coverage were achieved in the structured farmland area. The whole-area coverage path planning method based on the optimal turning mode of ASUAV was applicable to the farmland with arbitrary convex polygon structure. GUI program could optimize flight route with the highest efficiency while calculating flight point coordinates of ground boundary. An irregular convex hexagonal field with an area of about 2.7 hm2 was randomly planned in the field. The simulation results showed that when ASUAV was flying parallel to the longest side of the field, the invalid distance was the shortest with about 540 m, and the efficiency was the highest which was close to 90%. The optimized turning mode, take-off and landing location, flight heading and route inflection point coordinates can realize the full area coverage.

The existing maritime search and rescue networking and model have slow response speed and low efficiency. The distribution, synergy, parallelism, robustness and intelligence of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provide a new idea for the novel maritime search and rescue networking, in which multi-agent could be used to build a layered control network. In this paper, a novel rapid search and rescue system is proposed by utilizing the improved ant colony optimization and the independent calculation decision of the agents. The system adopts the edge computing, relies on the information sharing and the cooperative decision between the search and rescue agent groups. It achieves the independent synchronous search and rescue. At the same time, we use particle swarm optimization to intelligently schedule data packets during the rescue process to optimize network forwarding performance. Based on the distributed cluster control of USV and UAV, this paper combines edge computing, cooperative communication and centralized task allocation together to make decision for rescue.

However, the on-site acquisition of GCPs takes considerable manpower and time. This research aims to provide an efficient and accurate way to replace the on-site GNSS surveying with three different sources of geospatial data. The three geospatial data used in this study is as follows; 1) 25 cm aerial orthoimages, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on 1:1000 digital topographic map, 2) point cloud data acquired by Mobile Mapping System (MMS), and 3) hybrid point cloud data created by merging MMS data with UAV data. For each dataset a three-dimensional positional accuracy analysis of UAV-based orthoimage and DSM was performed by comparing differences in three-dimensional coordinates of independent check point obtained with those of the RTK-GNSS survey. The result shows the third case, in which MMS data and UAV data combined, to be the most accurate, showing an RMSE accuracy of 8.9 cm in horizontal and 24.5 cm in vertical, respectively. In addition, it has been shown that the distribution of geospatial GCPs has more sensitive on the vertical accuracy than on horizontal accuracy. © 2020 Korean Journal of Remote Sensing.},

	abstract = {In order to meet the navigation requirements of high-accurate and high-reliable for hypersonic vehicles, a quadratic intelligent optimization method which can identify error parameters of strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) in launch inertial coordinate system is proposed. The error compensating model and the complete nonlinear navigation model of the SINS are established, which can provide accurate model basis for optimization calculation. Based on information of the SINS/GPS/CNS integrated navigation system, the optimization model of gyro errors and the optimization model of accelerometer errors are built, and the quadratic intelligent strategy is adopted to estimate error parameters of the SINS. Firstly, error parameters of gyro are identified and compensated by using the particle swarm algorithm. On this basis, the error parameters of accelerometer are identified by using the particle swarm algorithm. The simulation results show that the quadratic optimization identification method can high-accurate identify the error parameters of the SINS online based on information of the integrated navigation system and the nonlinear optimization model, and the relative errors of optimization parameters of gyro and accelerometer are within 20%, and the navigation precision of the hypersonic vehicle is improved significantly. © 2020, Editorial Office of Control and Decision.

	abstract = {This article proposes a robust load frequency control using a new optimal proportional–integral–derivative controller–based genetic moth swarm algorithm for islanded microgrids considering high wind power penetration. In such microgrids, the replacement of conventional generator units with a large number of renewable energy sources reduces the system inertia, which in turn causes undesirable influence on microgrid frequency stability, leading to weakening of the microgrid. Furthermore, sudden load shedding, load restoring, and short circuits caused large frequency fluctuations which threaten the system security and could lead to complete blackouts as well as damages to the system equipment. In order to solve this challenge, this study proposes a new coordinated optimal load frequency control plus modified control signal to superconducting magnetic energy storage for compensating the microgrid frequency deviation (∆f). To prove the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control strategy, an islanded microgrid was tested for the MATLAB/Simulink simulation. The physical constraints of the turbines such as generation rate constraints and speed governor dead band are considered in this study. The results confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed coordination performance against all scenarios of different load profiles, wind power fluctuation, and system uncertainties in microgrid integrated with high penetration of wind farms. Moreover, the results have been compared with both: the optimal load frequency control with/without the effect of conventional superconducting magnetic energy storage. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Research interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also referred to as drones, has been steadily surging over the past several decades. With the advances in hardware, software, and communication technologies, the size of UAVs is shrinking and thus many applications are emerging. The applications of UAVs are anticipated in almost all fields including healthcare, agriculture, energy, search & rescue, transportation, surveillance, and even in communications to extend the reach of Internet. Some of the applications may require a group of UAVs to work together in a coordinated manner. In general, all UAV operations need to be sophisticated, smart, and autonomous. This is particularly so for coordinated operations that involve multiple UAVs. The opportunities and emerging applications of UAVs are numerous and so are the challenges. This paper discusses some of the typical applications of UAVs, opportunities they provide, and some of the challenges they pose.

	abstract = {Smart system applications (SSAs) built on top of cyber-physical and socio-technical systems are increasingly composed of components that can work both autonomously and by cooperating with each other. Cooperating robots, fleets of cars and fleets of drones, emergency coordination systems are examples of SSAs. One approach to enable cooperation of SSAs is to form dynamic cooperation groups—ensembles—between components at runtime. Ensembles can be formed based on predefined rules that determine which components should be part of an ensemble based on their current state and the state of the environment (e.g., “group together 3 robots that are closer to the obstacle, their battery is sufficient and they would not be better used in another ensemble”). This is a computationally hard problem since all components are potential members of all possible ensembles at runtime. In our experience working with ensembles in several case studies the past years, using constraint programming to decide which ensembles should be formed does not scale for more than a limited number of components and ensembles. Also, the strict formulation in terms of hard/soft constraints does not easily permit for runtime self-adaptation via learning. This poses a serious limitation to the use of ensembles in large-scale and partially uncertain SSAs. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to recast the ensemble formation problem as a classification problem and use machine learning to efficiently form ensembles at scale. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In such cases, the pilot's commands are unknown a priori (unpredictable), meaning that the UAVs must respond in near real time to the movements of the leader UAV in order to maintain swarm consistency. In this paper we develop a protocol for the coordination of UAVs in a swarm where the swarm leader is controlled by a real pilot, and the other UAVs must follow it in real time to maintain swarm cohesion. We validate our solution using a realistic simulation software that we developed (ArduSim), testing flights with multiple numbers of UAVs and different swarm configurations.

	abstract = {The operation of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) indoors faces many challenges, notably from the ineffectiveness of the sensors typically used on these vehicles for flight in outdoor environments, such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and magnetometers. However, there are many situations when the ability to use a UAV indoors is desirable, such as for surveying underground infrastructure, performing inventory of a warehouse or assisting in search-and-rescue operations. This paper addresses three challenges facing the autonomous indoor flight of UAVs. First, it proposes a platform for developing a low-cost UAV system using commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software. The system consists of one or more quadrotors, an ultrasonic beacon system and a ground control station. Next, this work proposes a method for using an ultrasonic beacon system to measure yaw. Finally, the paper introduces a technique for reducing the required number of beacons used in a large space by coordinating a network of multiple vehicles equipped with beacons to provide localization to a vehicle performing a mission. The algorithm for choosing waypoints for each vehicle is described, and simulations for the algorithms are presented for multiple cases. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (multi-UAVs) applications are recently growing in several fields, ranging from military and rescue missions, remote sensing, and environmental surveillance, to meteorology, logistics, and farming. Overcoming the limitations on battery lifespan and on-board processor capabilities, the coordinated use of multi-UAVs is indeed more suitable than employing a single UAV in certain tasks. Hence, the research on swarm of UAVs is receiving increasing attention, including multidisciplinary aspects, such as coordination, aggregation, network communication, path planning, information sensing, and data fusion. The focus of this paper is on defining novel control strategies for the deployment of multi-UAV systems in a distributed time-varying set-up, where UAVs rely on local communication and computation. In particular, modeling the dynamics of each UAV by a discrete-time integrator, we analyze the main swarm intelligence strategies, namely flight formation, swarm tracking, and social foraging. First, we define a distributed control strategy for steering the agents of the swarm towards a collection point. Then, we cope with the formation control, defining a procedure to arrange agents in a family of geometric formations, where the distance between each pair of UAVs is predefined. Subsequently, we focus on swarm tracking, defining a distributed mechanism based on the so-called leader-following consensus to move the entire swarm in accordance with a predefined trajectory. Moreover, we define a social foraging strategy that allows agents to avoid obstacles, by imposing on-line a time-varying formation pattern. Finally, through numerical simulations we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

With the whole system composed of the six-degree-of-freedom UAV model, the cooperative guidance algorithm, and the cooperative control algorithm, the formation control strategy is a closed-loop one and with full states. The cooperative guidance law is a second-order consensus algorithm, providing the desired acceleration, pitch rate, and heading rate. Longitudinal and lateral motions are jointly considered, and the cooperative control law is designed by deducing state equations. Closed-loop stability of the formation is analyzed, and a necessary and sufficient condition is provided. Measurement errors in position data are suppressed by synchronization technology to improve the control precision.

	abstract = {Measuring radiation dosage rates is becoming more and more important in many applications scenarios. Continuously monitoring radiation in contaminated and poorly accessible areas is challenging due to the frequent data collection/transmission combined with long life requirements. We present a self-sustainable wireless sensor node for low power, high precision radiation dosage rate monitoring. We propose an energy-efficient data acquisition algorithm that can reduce the energy per measurement, while guaranteeing minimal loss of precision. The proposed node is designed to work in collaboration with an unmanned aerial vehicle used for two essential mission steps: Air-deployment of the wireless sensor nodes at suitable locations, and acquiring data logs via low-power, shortrange radio communication in fly-by mode after a wake-up command. The system uses off-the-shelf components for defining the mission, drop-zone, and trajectory, for compressing data and managing communication. The node is equipped with a novel low-power nuclear radiation sensor, and has been designed and implemented with self-sustainability in mind as it will be deployed in hazardous, inaccessible areas. To this end, the proposed node uses a combination of complementary techniques: A low-power microcontroller with non-volatile memory, energy harvesting, adaptive power management, and a nano-watt wake-up radio. Experimental results demonstrate the precision and the low energy consumption of the radiation sensor, the energy efficiency of the whole solution, and the acquisition algorithms. The node consumes only 31μW in sleep mode and 1.7mW in active mode, and has the capability to achieve perpetual monitoring once deployed. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are favored by the industry to search and locate lost persons in mountains and trapped persons in earthquakes, fires and other disasters because it is not limited by the obstructions on the ground. Currently, however, a UAV always searches and locates targets along a fixed flight path, which consumes more time and has lower accuracy. This kind of method can only provide a rough position estimation. GuideLoc takes the UAV’s GPS coordinates as the location information of a target and the genetic algorithm (GA) is used for path planning in order to shorten the flight path to improve the search efficiency and obtain a good result. But its performance still has room for improvement. In this paper, the path optimization algorithm used in GuideLoc is further discussed and studied, and then a method, 2-OptACO, is proposed. The method uses the 2-optimization (2-opt) algorithm to improve the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) and is applied to optimize the UAV’s path for search and rescue. The simulation results show that the 2-OptACO method has a faster convergence rate than the GA and ACO. It can obtain a better global optimal solution. © 2018 Institute of Information Science.

First, the ideal framework and engineering feasible framework systems of parallel CPSS facing to next generation of energy and electric power systems (EEPS) are constructed. In addition, novel high-precision mirrored computational experiment approaches are proposed based on data-driven and self-correction mechanisms, thus an optimal approximation from mirrored system to the real physical system can be achieved. Moreover, knowledge automation and parallel machine learning are comprehensively studied for centralized / decentralized dispatch of future EEPS, which can effectively achieve a knowledge self-exploration for RoboECs as well as significantly enhance their swarm intelligence. Besides, the convergence property between the coordinated parallel system and real system is discussed in depth, together with design of global closed-loop CPSS, so that a highly incorporated and systematic engineering design of energy, information and society can be realized.

	abstract = {To overcome the problems encountered in predicting the endurance of electric-powered fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which were stemmed from the dynamic changes in electric power system efficiency and battery discharge characteristics under different operating conditions, the required battery power model and battery discharge model were studied. The required battery power model was determined using an approximate model of electric power system efficiency based on wind tunnel testing and the self-adaptive penalty function. Furthermore, current correction and ambient temperature correction terms were proposed for the trained Kriging model representing the discharge characteristics under standard operation, and then the discharged capacity-terminal voltage model was established. Through numerical integration of this model with the required battery power model, the electric-powered fixed-wing UAV endurance prediction model was obtained. Laboratory tests indicated that the proposed endurance model could precisely calculate the battery discharge time and accurately describe the battery discharge process. The similarity of the theoretical and flight test results reflected the accuracy of the proposed endurance model as well as the importance of considering dynamic changes in power system efficiency in endurance calculations.

The popularity of Formation Control to researchers is primarily do to its use to coordinate the movement of a swarm of robots. However, there are multiple algorithms that can coordinate the control of robotic swarm. In this paper, a novel leader-follower formation control algorithm was developed to control a formation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using only stereo camera, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), without the need of feature or pattern matching. Stereo cameras are chosen for formation control purposes because they allow the camera to guarantee that the field of view of the cameras of the various UAVs always have some overlap. Assuring there are no gaps in the field of view of the UAVs is important for missions such as search and rescue. Two different control algorithms were developed: direct method, and PID control. The results were tested in a simulation environments consisting of non-erroneous non-linear dynamics to verify its robustness. A novel formation controller is successfully developed which uses GPS, IMU and stereo camera input, without the need for feature or pattern matching and the computed results verify the effectiveness of our developed algorithm. © 2018 TSI Press.},

	abstract = {The adoption of collaboration strategies among logistics facilities and the formation of one or multiple coalitions constitute a sustainable approach to vehicle routing network optimization. This paper introduces a collaborative multiple centers vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (CMCVRPSDP) to minimize operating cost and the total number of vehicles in the network. Distribution and pickup centers are allowed to share vehicles and customers in order to increase the entire network's efficiency and maximize profit. To provide the coalition coordinators with good routing solutions, we propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm which properly combines k-means and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Based on clustering solutions, the proposed Hybrid NSGA-II (HNSGA-II) first generates a real coded population to bind our mathematical model constraints and to obtain a large number of feasible solutions which converge to optimality. Chromosomes are divided for genetic operations with partial mapped crossover and swap mutation algorithms, before their recombination to ensure the quality of our results. Comparisons with the traditional NSGA-II and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm indicate better performances of HNSGA-II in terms of objective function values. We also apply Cost Gap Allocation method (CGA) and the strictly monotonic path selection principle to examine profit allocation schemes. Numerical analyses on part of Chongqing city's logistics network show the superiority of HNSGA-II over MOPSO and NSGA-II on the practical case study, as well that of CGA over the Minimum Costs-Remaining Savings (MCRS), Shapley and Game Quadratic Programming (GQP) methods. In addition, the proposed profit allocation approach has supported the establishment of a grand coalition instead of two sub-coalitions. CMCVRPSDP optimization reduces long-haul transportation, improves the vehicle loading rate and facilitates sustainable development. Through the rational allocation of profits, the proposed solution methodology assures the stability and fairness among coalition members. The implementation is also important to design sustainable urban transportation networks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Authors, thanks to a consolidated experience in marine robotics, are building a sail propelled marine drone for a sustainable monitoring of wide sea areas. In particular, sail propulsion assures a near to infinite autonomy since limited energy demand of on board electronic can be assured by renewable sources such as solar cells. However, to correctly manage a sail system, a correct estimation of wind intensity and its direction is essential. Conventional anemometers make use of delicate mechanical moving parts, are therefore not suitable to work autonomously in difficult environments such as the marine one. Commercial ultrasonic anemometers represent a valid alternative but their cost, weight and size need to be optimized for the proposed application which is a cheap, light and relatively small drone. In this work the authors redesigned both acoustic and electronic system to meet the required specifications. Innovations have been suggested in terms of materials, components and introducing a smart measurement algorithm that allowed the authors to simplify the design, construction and calibration of the instrument. Finally, the system has been tested and calibrated in a wind tunnel, introducing a simple and effective calibration algorithm able to drastically reject disturbances arising from interference between mechanical system and the wind flow under measurement. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this context, different problems need to be solved: robot control, robot perception, multi-robot system coordination, global and local planning/re-planning etc. For example, choosing a good coordination mechanism is a difficult task that depends on the application and can be done via trial and error experiments and comparative studies. Some guidelines can be learned from the case studies reported in the literature. Moreover, artificial intelligence provides several techniques (e.g. rule-based systems, machine learning, artificial neural networks, swarm intelligence) that can improve the performances of multi-robot systems coordination. Regarding experimental comparative studies between different methods, a cheaper solution is given by simulations. On the other hand, knowledge sharing between robots can be provided by ontologies that facilitate the inter-robot communication as a base of multi-robot system coordination. Our research work focus on modelling a multi-robot system as an agent based system which is a proper choice for distributed systems and enables simulations.

	abstract = {Sustainable supply chain management is important for most firms in today's competitive environment. This study considers a supply chain environment under which the firm needs to make decisions regarding from which supplier and what quantity of parts should be purchased, which vehicle with a certain emissions amount and transportation capacity should be assigned, and what kind of production mode should be used. The integrated replenishment, transportation, and production problem is concerned with coordinating replenishment, transportation, and production operations to meet customer demand with the objective of minimizing the cost. The problem considered in this study involves heterogeneous vehicles with different emission costs, various materials with dissimilar emission costs, and distinct production modes, each with their own emission costs. In addition, multiple suppliers with different quantity discount schemes are considered, different kinds of vehicles with different loading capacities and traveling distance limits are present, and different production modes with different production capacities and production costs are included. A mixed integer programming model is proposed first to minimize the total cost, which includes the ordering cost, purchase cost, transportation cost, emission cost, production cost, inventory-holding cost, and backlogging cost, while satisfying various constraints in replenishment, transportation, and production. A particle swarm optimization model is constructed next to deal with large-scale problems that are too complicated to solve by the mixed integer programming. The main advantage of the proposed models lies in their ability to simultaneously coordinate the replenishment, transportation, and production operations in a planning horizon. The proposed particle swarm optimization model could further identify a near-optimal solution to the complex problem in a very short computational time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the sustainable supply chain management problem with multiple suppliers, multiple vehicles, and multiple production modes simultaneously. Case studies are presented to examine the practicality of the mixed integer programming and the particle swarm optimization models. The proposed models can be adopted by the management to make relevant supply chain management decisions. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Indoor visible light positioning has become a research hotspot owing to its high accuracy, low cost, and easy implementation. However, many existing indoor positioning systems based on visible light communication (VLC) can only achieve two-dimensional (2-D) positioning and those focusing on three-dimensional (3-D) positioning usually contain various sensors or use complex algorithms. Consequently, a high-precision indoor 3-D positioning system based on VLC using modified artificial fish swarm algorithm is proposed, avoiding the problems mentioned above. To simplify the solution procedure of searching for 3-D coordinates, the 3-D positioning problem is transformed into a global optimization problem with the corresponding fitness function designed according to Lambertian radiation pattern. The simulation executed on 1350 points shows an average 3-D positioning error of 4.05 mm in an indoor space of 4 m × 4 m × 6 m, and 90% positioning errors are below 5.95 mm. Moreover, when tracking a moving target in the positioning space, the average error is 3.57 mm and the maximum error is 7.25 mm.

	abstract = {In order to provide a fast multi-UAV cooperative data acquisition approach for 3D building model reconstruction in emergency management domain, a route planning methodology is proposed. A minimum image set including camera shooting positions and attitudes can be firstly obtained, with the given parameters describing the target building, UAVs, cameras, and image overlap requirements. A specific flight route network is then determined, and the optimal solution for multi-UAV data capture route planning is computed on the basis of constraint conditions such as the time frame, UAV battery endurance, and take-off and landing positions. Furthermore, field experiments with manual operating UAV mode, single UAV mode, and multi-UAV mode were conducted to compare the data collection and processing runtimes, as well as the quality of created 3D building models. According to the five defined LoDs of OGC CityGML 2.0 standard, the fine 3D building models conform to the LoD3. Comparison results demonstrate that our method is able to greatly enhance the efficiency of 3D reconstruction by improving the data collection speed while minimizing redundant image datasets, as well as to provide a normalized approach to assign the single or multi-UAV data acquisition tasks. The quality analysis of 3D models shows that the metric difference is less than 20 cm mean error with a standard deviation of 11 cm, which is fairly acceptable in emergency management study field. A 3D GIS-based software demo was also implemented to enable route planning, flight simulation, and data collection visualization. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Geolocation, i.e. calculating the global coordinate of identified diseased regions based on images taken, is an important step in automating such a scouting operation. In this paper, the problem of geolocating multiple diseased regions in an image is studied. Based on the assumptions of stationary, two-dimensional shallow target plants and hover flight, an orthographic projection-based measurement model is developed. A probabilistic data association method is used to analyze the measurements from different target sources and a Kalman filter is designed to estimate the suspected diseased leaves’ position. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time a data association technique is used in for locating multiple-diseased plants in agriculture applications. Additionally, the designed Kalman filter is based on conditions pertinent to small crops and is less computationally intensive than the typically used extended Kalman filter. Both simulation and ad hoc experiments are used to validate the proposed multitarget geolocation algorithm. © IMechE 2017.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve continuous non-linear optimization problems. The presented algorithm is a collective global search inspired by the swarm artificial intelligent of coordinated robots. Cooperative recognition and sensing by a swarm of mobile robots have been fundamental inspirations for development of Swarm Robotics Search & Rescue (SRSR). Swarm robotics is an approach with the aim of coordinating multi-robot systems which consist of numbers of mostly uniform simple physical robots. The ultimate aim is to emerge an eligible cooperative behavior either from interactions of autonomous robots with the environment or their mutual interactions between each other. In this algorithm, robots which represent initial solutions in SRSR terminology have a sense of environment to detect victim in a search & rescue mission at a disaster site. In fact, victim's location refers to global best solution in SRSR algorithm. The individual with the highest rank in the swarm is called master and remaining robots will play role of slaves. However, this leadership and master position can be transitioned from one robot to another one during mission. Having the supervision of master robot accompanied with abilities of slave robots for sensing the environment, this collaborative search assists the swarm to rapidly find the location of victim and subsequently a successful mission. In order to validate effectiveness and optimality of proposed algorithm, it has been applied on several standard benchmark functions and a practical electric power system problem in several real size cases. Finally, simulation results have been compared with those of some well-known algorithms. Comparison of results demonstrates superiority of presented algorithm in terms of quality solutions and convergence speed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

This project deals with an UAV (ornithopter) with morphed wing, in which the wing can be foldable to increase the gliding speed. By using such type of wings, endurance and range can be increased. A laboratory scale ornithopter with flapping wing mechanism is fabricated and tested. The flight speed of almost 45mph can be achieved. This mechanism reduces the battery consumption, for e.g. for 8V input, 4 flaps per second is demonstrated by test. UAV has the ability to attack enemy territory without being identified by the RADAR. Moreover, it can be used to drop bombs from high altitude with precision by using high resolution cameras. To overcome this difficulty, the ornithopter with morphing and flapping mechanism concept is considered in this project. © 2018. MechAero Foundation for Technical Research & Education Excellence.},

The proposed energy resource management schedule in a micro-grid, including fuel cells, micro turbines, solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries, intelligently meets the needs of the grid. Apart from using the aforementioned resources, VPP can also purchase additional energy from upper utility to respond to the load. In addition, the proposed method plans suitably a micro-grid using a multi-objective framework, which minimizes the total operation cost and emission caused by the generating units simultaneously. To achieve this goal, the multi-objective Ant Lion Optimizer (MOALO) has been used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and to produce Pareto optimal solutions. The fuzzy technique has been used for the decision making process. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results have been compared with multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), which shows that the use of the MOALO method in the presence of fuzzy technique attain the superior solutions on the operation cost and the emission of pollutant. © 2017 IEEE.},

Among all the envisioned applications, environmental monitoring and disaster recovery are very interesting and promising. In this scenario, drones instrumented with environmental sensors are driven into contaminated or inaccessible areas to collect samples (air, water, soil, etc.) and to estimate their wholesomeness, before human intervention. Many challenges are still open in this field, from the design of a suitable artificial intelligence for autonomous driving to the maximization of energy autonomy. In this paper we focus on the interface between gas sensors and drone equipment, in particular we discuss the issue of minimizing the weight of the payload and the accuracy of the measurement, processing and streaming relevant data to the final users.

	abstract = {We describe the development of a BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line-Of-Sight) model aircraft (UAV). The broad design requirements included (i) fuselage capable of accommodating an imaging package or other instrumentation, (ii) suitability for over-lake BVLOS authorization in Switzerland, (iii) capability of land or water take-offs/landing, (iv) at least 90-min flight autonomy, (v) modularity of the imaging package and (vi) real-time IR/RGB imagery. Requirement (i) was to ensure an aircraft amenable to future developments. Requirements (ii)–(iv) were driven by the goal of improving estimates of lake surface energy fluxes, since such fluxes have a major impact on long-term lake temperatures and hence ecological status. Requirement (v), in conjunction with (i), allows the UAV to be adapted to other imaging applications. The real-time imagery requirement (vi) permits modifications of on-going missions to map areas of specific interest as they are detected. The prototype UAV produced to satisfy these characteristics was built on the twin-motor My Twin Dream (MTD) aircraft, which has a 1.8-m wing span airframe and a spacious fuselage. The legal authorization necessitated, where feasible, hardware redundancy as well as installation of a parachute system. Continuous communication between the ground station and UAV is provided by the LTE cellular telephone network. The UAV communication is handled by an on-board Linux computer, which is also responsible for control of the imagery package. The avionics involved modifications of the open-source APM autopilot software and the associated ground control station. A key modification was to support a custom-built emergency recovery system, which is triggered by loss of a heart-beat signal from the autopilot. The MTD airframe was modified to accommodate the system electronics and imaging hardware. Results from test flights over Lake Geneva demonstrate the ability of the aircraft to produce imagery data. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {A Stirling engine displays an aptitude for utilizing sustainable energy (such as solar energy) and exhibits the same theoretical efficiency as that of a Carnot cycle. However, the actual efficiency of a Stirling engine is far from the ideal Carnot efficiency due to irreversibilities. Models proposed in previous studies that focused on the imperfect regenerative process are crude and require improvements. In this study, finite time thermodynamics is employed to construct a refined model that considers the finite rate of heat transfer, conductive thermal bridging loss, and regenerative loss that is supplied by the heat source. Based on the model, three objective functions including power, efficiency, and ecological coefficient of performance (ECOP) of a Stirling engine are simultaneously optimized for maximization. A multi-objective optimization method based on a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm using crowding distance (MOPSOCD) is employed to optimize the Stirling engine for the first time. Solutions obtained using the MOPSOCD comprise the Pareto set. The optimal solution is then selected using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. The performance under the multi-objective optimization is compared with those of single-objective optimization methods in terms of power, efficiency, and ECOP. The results reveal that MOPSOCD exhibits good coordination in terms of the power, efficiency, and ECOP of the Stirling engine and may serve as a promising guide for operating and designing Stirling engines. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Radars and sensors are essential devices for an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) to detect obstacles. Their precision has improved significantly in recent years with relatively accurate capability to locate obstacles. However, small detection errors in the estimation and prediction of trajectories of obstacles may cause serious problems in accuracy, thereby damaging the judgment of USV and affecting the effectiveness of collision avoidance. In this study, the effect of radar errors on the prediction accuracy of obstacle position is studied on the basis of the autoregressive prediction model. The cause of radar error is also analyzed. Subsequently, a bidirectional adaptive filtering algorithm based on polynomial fitting and particle swarm optimization is proposed to eliminate the observed errors in vertical and abscissa coordinates. Then, simulations of obstacle tracking and prediction are carried out, and the results show the validity of the algorithm. Finally, the method is used to simulate the collision avoidance of USV, and the results show the validity and reliability of the algorithm. © 2019 Lifei Song, et al., published by Sciendo 2019.},

The line 44: Fig. 2. Examples of fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platforms for trace gas monitoring [5]. The line 47: The aircraft's flight height, duration, load lift capacity is influenced by its size. These aircrafts can be considered as the category of MINI UAVs (MUAV) [4, 5, 6]. The line 61: For each pixel of each photo they usually capture 5-7 spectral bands, of which 1-2 bands captures part of the NIR wave spectrum, the red and green spectra, and spectrum corresponding color red is divided into several parts, since in case of plant investigation, the so-called Red Edge range is extremely informative (helpful) [7]. The line 67: In this case, the information is captured by a slightly different principle ("Push-broom") – not by capturing a rectangular picture, but one line of pixels, that represent one band spectrum instead and the entire sensor travels with the aircraft in the desired direction, simultaneously covering same pixels with all different possible bands [4, 7, 9]. The line 68: There are also attempts to produce small lightweight camera-type spectrometers [8, 9] (Fig. 3). The line 78: The suitability of these systems for further research, industrial or everyday life application depends on that [8, 9].

The line 151: Published literature on this topic over decade points out that due to specific local characteristics, the previous reliance on first-class kinetic models for the formation of methane of a landfill as a basis for predicting emissions is not precise, it is necessary to replace better, more scientifically based methodology for the following reasons [11–15]: 3.

An orthophoto was generated from the photos using the Trimble Business Center Photogrammetry Module (TBC) software, with an average pixel size (equivalent on the ground - GSD) of 14.4 cm (2015), 3.5 cm (2016) and colored with corresponding RGB value (Fig. 5). The line 202: By comparing visually (Fig. 4), it is evident that the vegetation in the northern part of the territory is livelier, and the slopes of the reservoirs of sediment located in the western part of the territory are changing. The line 213: There are various types of sensors that can be mounted on a UAV to detect greenhouse gas and VOC traces in the lower part of the atmosphere. The most commonly used methods are electrochemical, photoionization, infrared (IR) laser absorption, semiconductor and catalytic detection. Although each method is fundamentally different, all types of sensors must be able to detect levels of ambient atmospheric concentration and also have a dynamic range that covers the range of gas that is expected to be [5]. 4.

The line 267: French Environment Agency (ADEME) on the strength of research of K. Spokas and others, has set guidelines, such as: methane emissions are reduced by 90% for the area covered by the geomembrane and an active gas collection or incineration system [11].

	abstract = {In recent years, we have seen an uptrend in the popularity of UAVs driven by the desire to apply these aircraft to areas such as precision farming, infrastructure and environment monitoring, surveillance, surveying and mapping, search and rescue missions, weather forecasting, and more. These aircraft are more often being fully powered by electric power sources and a major technical hurdle is that of drastically reducing overall power consumption so they can be powered by solar arrays, and for long periods of time. To do so, the power requirement of an aircraft and the conversion efficiency of its propulsion system, from electrical energy to thrust, must be parametrized so that it can be improved. This paper describes a high-fidelity, low-order power model for electric, fixed-wing unmanned aircraft using flight path information. The motivation behind this work is the development of computationally-intensive, long-endurance solar-powered unmanned aircraft, the UIUC Solar Flyer, which will have continuous daylight ability to acquire and process high resolution visible and infrared imagery. Therefore, having an accurate power model will aid in providing the ability to predict power usage for future mission flight segments, which will be vital for energy-conscious path planning. Compared to works in the existing literature, the model presented follows a holistic approach for fixed-wing electric UAV power modeling that encompasses both aircraft aerodynamics and propulsion models under realistic assumptions. The model developed is able to very accurately estimate the power consumption of an electric UAV based on flight path state, without needing precise aerodynamic measurements, therefore doing so with minimal computation power. The propulsion power model was evaluated by means of flight testing as well as simulation and showed errors ranging from negligible to approximately 5%. © 2018 AIAA.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous small rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated sorties for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy including emergency response to enable mission execution independently from human operators, and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. Experimental results of up to 11 hours of fully autonomous operation in indoor and outdoor environments illustrate the capability of our system. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, sensing systems in urban environments are being replaced by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAVs, also known as drones, have shown great potential in executing different kinds of sensing missions, such as search and rescue, object tracking, inspection, etc. The UAVs' sensing capabilities and their agile mobility can replace existing complex solutions for such missions. However, coordinating a swarm of drones for mission accomplishment is not a trivial task. Existing works in the literature focus solely on managing the swarm and do not provide options for automating entire missions. In this paper, we present PaROS (PROgramming Swarm), a novel framework for programming a swarm of UAVs. PaROS provides a set of programming primitives for orchestrating a swarm of drones along with automating certain types of missions. These primitives, referred as abstract swarms, control every drone in the swarm, hiding the complexity of low level details from a programmer such as assigning flight plans, task partitioning, failure recovery and area division. Our experimental evaluation proves that our approach is stable, time-efficient and practical. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a frequency regulation strategy to enable the participation of wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs). The optimal strategy focuses on developing the frequency support capability of PMSGs connected to the power system. Active power control is performed using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and de-loaded control to supply the required power reserve following a disturbance. A kinetic energy (KE) reserve control is developed to enhance the frequency regulation capability of wind turbines. The coordination with the de-loaded control prevents instability in the PMSG wind system due to excessive KE discharge. A KE optimization method that maximizes the sum of the KE reserves at wind farms is also adopted to determine the de-loaded power reference for each PMSG wind turbine using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control and operation strategy, three different case studies are conducted using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation tool. The results demonstrate that the optimal strategy enhances the frequency support contribution from PMSG wind turbines. © 2017 by the author.},

	abstract = {The resiliency of power distribution systems is becoming an important issue worldwide as far as the continuity of economic growth and prosperity is concerned. In this regard, the concept of networked microgrids (MGs) is promising to play a significant role in improving the resiliency of MGs after natural disasters. In this chapter, the proposed energy management system aims to effectively coordinate the local MG control center with the distribution network operator to enhance the efficiency of power distribution between the MGs considering the connection of MGs with the distribution network. Another strategy for improving the resiliency of MGs is to deploy demand response programs (DRPs). By changing the power consumption pattern, DRPs could enable the logical utilization of electricity for the consumers. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed energy management structure for interconnected MGs, the resiliency of MGs is studied in two different operation modes. First is the normal operation mode, in which each MG operates in a normal condition without natural disasters. Second is the emergency mode, in which MGs lose their connection with the distribution grid. So the connection between MGs plays a key role in feeding loads after the power supply interruption due to a natural disaster. Moreover, the uncertainties of renewable energy sources and loads are modeled using probability distribution function. Monte Carlo simulation is used to produce the required scenarios for the study. In this chapter, the optimization problem is formulated as a bi-level one, where the objective function is minimized using a heuristic algorithm, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results obtained by PSO are compared with those from a stochastic optimization method. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, pesticide application using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has developed rapidly in China. It is very suitable for complex terrain, highly efficient, and capable of dealing with sudden disasters at low risk. Meanwhile, it can reduce the harm of pesticides to human and environmental pollution. However, aerial application is very sensitive to meteorological conditions, which leads to increase of spray drift and nonuniform deposition distribution. A bipolar contact charging electrostatic (BCCE) spraying system for UAV was designed. The electrostatic spray system consisted of power source of electrostatic generator, power source of spray unit, electrostatic generator unit (with power switch and voltage regulator), positive and negative output electrode, tanks, pumps, controller and centrifugal atomizers. The electrostatic generator unit was the key component of BCCE spraying system, which consisted of a negative output electrostatic generator and a positive output electrostatic generator in series connection. The electrostatic generator unit could not only enhance the charging effort but also ensure the electric balance on UAV. The electrostatic spraying system included 2 separate tanks, which were connected to the positive and negative output electrodes of the high voltage electrostatic generator, respectively. So spraying liquid in different tanks was charged positively or negatively, and the charged liquid was atomized into droplets by centrifugal nozzles and then adsorbed onto the leaves of the crop. The output voltage of BCCE spraying system could be adjusted from 15 to 35 kV, and its pump pressure varied from 0.02 to 0.1 MPa. The charge-mass ratio (CMR) and droplet spectrum of spraying liquid for electro-chargeable liquid (ED) and water were measured in the laboratory. The result showed that the volume medium diameter (VMD) of ED was significantly smaller than that of water sprayed by atomizers of BCCE spraying system connected with the positive and the negative output electrode. For water spraying, using BCCE spraying system in different electrostatic voltage (EV), there were no significant differences in VMD and relative span (RS) in both output electrodes; meanwhile, the atomizer of positive voltage could reduce the VMD of ED, while atomizer of negative voltage could enhance the VMD of ED. When the spray liquid was ED, the RSs of droplet spectrum increased as the increase of EV supplied by the positive and negative output electrodes. The test of charging performance showed that the CMR of spray liquids charged by positive and negative output electrodes both increased with the increase of EV. Using the same EV and output electrode, the CMR of water was much higher than ED. With the same EV and spray liquid the CMR charged by negative output electrode was obviously higher than positive output electrode. Experiments were conducted in wheat field, the BCCE spraying system was carried by a single rotor motor UAV 3WQF120-12 to spray ED, and the original spraying system of 3WQF120-12 equipped with 2 LU120-01 nozzles spraying ED and water-based pesticide was chosen for the comparison on pesticide deposition and control effect of wheat aphid and rust. The field experiment result showed that the deposition amounts of both ED treatments were 0.048 6 and 0.051 3 μg/cm2, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the water-based pesticide solution with 0.035 6 μg/cm2. The ED treatment sprayed by BCCE spraying system had the best uniformity in deposition with a standard deviation of 0.015 μg/cm2 and a coefficient of variation of 30.43%. The control efficiency and pesticide persistence of 2 ED treatments on wheat aphid and rust were significantly higher than the conventional water-based treatment. There was no significant difference in control efficiency of rust, and in wheat aphid 14 days after treatment between 2 ED treatments. In addition, the control efficiency of wheat aphid 7 days after treatment for BCCE spraying system was 87.92%, which was significantly higher than that for the UAV's original spraying system that was 76.43%. Therefore, the BCCE spraying system with ED can improve the uniformity of deposition and increase biological control effect. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Although current search patterns (e.g., traditional "lawn mower" methods) are thorough, they result in too much time spent searching lowprobability areas. This decreases the chances of a successful rescue and increases the risk of lost recovery opportunities (e.g., death due to hypothermia in the case of human search targets). Our goal is to optimize UAV-based SAR operations. As directed by an onboard computer, UAVs would fly coordinated search patterns based on the target's last known position and the direction and speed of winds and currents. By enabling the UAVs to act collectively and cooperatively, we can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of a multi-UAV network's SAR mission. To achieve this, we applied cooperative game theory as an enabling function in the development of a cognitive system encompassing multiple vehicles. Based on simulations, we showed that an optimal dynamic search pattern and vehicle positioning strategy can be realized using decision algorithms based on elements of game theory. © 2018 SPIE.},

The VPP and MGs models are simulated and tested based on real parameters and loads data recorded in Perlis, Malaysia, employed on each bus of the system for 24 h. BBSA optimization algorithm provides the best binary fitness function, i.e., global minimum fitness for finding the best cell to generate the optimal schedule. The fitness function is generated based on real conditions such as solar irradiation and wind speed and preparation of battery charge/discharges, fuel states and demand of the specific hour. The obtained results show that the BBSA algorithm provides the best schedule to control DGs ON and OFF based on controller decision. Results obtained from the BBSA are compared with binary particle swarm optimization in terms of objective function and power saving to validate the developed controller. The developed BBSA optimization algorithm minimizes the power generation cost, reduces power losses, delivers reliable and high-quality power to the loads, and integrates priority-based sustainable MGs into the grid. Thus, VPP can enable efficient integration of DGs and MGs into the grid by balancing their variability. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

In order to address the issue of wireless jamming attacks, a new technique which localizes the jamming attackers and prevents vehicles from jamming through human intervention is proposed. In this article, we propose a range-free approach to localize the source of the attacker and determine the number of jamming attackers. The data set is the locating information and the jamming detection information associated with each vehicle. Then, we formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as a multiclass detection problem. We define the incorrectly classified area and use it to measure the distance between samples and centroids in fuzzy c-means algorithm. We further determine the number of jamming attackers through the coverage rate of beaconing circles and utilize weight-based fuzzy c-means to classify the data set. When the data set is classified as acceptable, we further explore the means of using particle swarm optimization algorithm to calculate the positional coordinates of each attacker. We simulate our techniques in MATLAB, and both urban traffic area and open area are considered in our simulation. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm can achieve high precision when determining the number of attackers while the result of the classified performance is always satisfying. Our localization results lead to higher accuracy than other existing solutions. Also, when the data set is limited, the chances of taking accurate localization are higher than other measures. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {In this study we consider the coordinated exploration of an unfamiliar Martian landscape by a swarm of small autonomous rovers, called Swarmies, simulated in a distributed setting. With a sustainable program of return missions to and from Mars in mind, the goal of said exploration is to efficiently prospect the terrain for water meant to be gathered and then utilized in the production of rocket fuel. The rovers are tasked with relaying relevant data to a home base that is responsible for maintaining a mining schedule for an arbitrarily large group of rovers extracting water-rich regolith. For this reason, it is crucial that the participants maintain a wireless connection with one another and with the base throughout the entire process. We describe the architecture of our simulation which is composed of HLA-compliant components that are visualized via the Distributed Observer Network tool developed by NASA. Additionally, a well-known terrain exploration algorithm, which takes the constraint of a mobile ad hoc network into account, is summarized and then extended by using a trainable genetic algorithm to determine the movement of the robotic swarm at every time step of the simulation. The integration of this extended algorithm into the distributed simulation is discussed and the empirical results of a comparison between the original and extended versions are given. Our results suggest that the genetic algorithm serves as a useful aid in the simulation of coordinated exploration and provides a layer of flexibility, offered by the trainable parameters its fitness function depends upon, that allows for the introduction of new constraints while maintaining compatibility with dynamic shifts in priority. © 2018 SAE International.

	abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as communication platforms is of great significance in future wireless networks, especially for on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Although prior works have shown the performance improvement by exploiting the UAV's mobility, they mainly focus on delay-tolerant applications. As delay requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained communication scenarios. Motivated by the above, we study, in this paper, an UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) network where an UAV is dispatched as the mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput, to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in general decreases as the users' MRRs become larger, which reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications. Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory initialization scheme is proposed based on the simple circular trajectory. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, the renewable resources such as wind farms assumed more attraction due to their features of being clean, no dependency to any type of fuel and having a low marginal cost. The output power of wind units is dependent on the wind speed which has a volatile and intermittent nature. This fact confronts the solution of unit commitment problem with some challenges when a huge amount of wind resources is penetrated and considerable uncertainties are included in the problem. Moreover, the demand of the system has some volatility in comparison with forecasted values. This kind of volatility and stochastic nature is another source of uncertainty in the power system. In this paper, thermal and wind units are incorporated and the optimization problem is solved by the employment of proper probability distribution function and the Monte Carlo simulation approach for dealing with uncertainties. Afterwards, the optimization problem is solved by the use of the binary form of gray wolf optimization algorithm and the m inimized total cost will be obtained. Ultimately, the unit commitment schedule and optimal generation of each unit are determined and the optimization results are compared with the solution of genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm. © 2018, Islamic Azad University.},

Unfortunately, existing HAUVs are commonly criticized for low efficiency and not able to satisfy the demand of operating longevity in both air and water. Attitude control of HAUV is also a significant challenge considering the vehicle’s airwater transition. This paper presents a novel HAUV with better endurance by merging the concepts of underwater gliders (UGs), multirotors, and the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) together. This paper firstly presents the dynamic models for the proposed HAUV. A mission based control strategy was then designed for the global control of the multi-domain mission. Finally, a simulation composed of underwater glide, vertical take-off, and forward flight was performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed HAUV. The results showed that the proposed HAUV successfully realized the multi-domain motion with the three modes, and the advantages of lower power consumption rate and extended moving ability were also demonstrated. © 2018 IEEE.},

The measurement precision of these systems depends on the accuracy of the extrinsic parameters. Therefore, it is important to accurately calibrate the extrinsic parameters between the onboard cameras. Unlike conventional multi-camera calibration methods with a common field of view (FOV), multi-camera calibration without overlapping FOVs has certain difficulties. In this paper, we propose a calibration method for a multi-camera system without common FOVs, which is used on aero photogrammetry. First, the extrinsic parameters of any two cameras in a multi-camera system is calibrated, and the extrinsic matrix is optimized by the reprojection error. Then, the extrinsic parameters of each camera are unified to the system reference coordinate system by using the global optimization method. A simulation experiment and a physical verification experiment are designed for the theoretical arithmetic. The experimental results show that this method is operable. The rotation error angle of the camera's extrinsic parameters is less than 0.001rad and the translation error is less than 0.08 mm. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Containing a wildfire requires an efficient response and persistent monitoring. A crucial aspect is the ability to search for the boundaries of the wildfire by exploring a wide area. However, even as wildfires are increasing today, the number of available monitoring systems that can provide support is decreasing, creating an operational gap and slow response in such urgent situations. The objective of this work is to estimate a propagating boundary and create an autonomous system that works in real time. It proposes a coordination strategy with a new methodology for estimating the periphery of a propagating phenomenon using limited observations. The complete system design, tested on the high-fidelity simulation, demonstrates that steering the vehicles toward the highest perpendicular uncertainty generates the effective predictions. The results indicate that the new coordination scheme has a large beneficial impact on uncertainty suppression. This study thus suggests that an efficient solution for suppressing uncertainty in monitoring a wildfire is to use a fleet of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that can be deployed quickly. Further research is needed on other deployment schemes that work in different natural disaster case studies. © 2018 Sharon Rabinovich et al.},

Image data acquired during flights require some integration with ground control points (GCPs) to improve data accuracy. Typical GCPs require precise geographic coordinates based on expensive surveying equipment for image location of the visible ground marker. However, GPS surveys for typical GCPs are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, especially when data collection is repeated at the same location multiple times in a season, in which case multiple GPS surveys are necessary. An autonomous GCP system based in part on a wireless network was developed for information collection and integration with fixed-wing UAV image data. The GCP system improves the speed of GCP setup and provides data collection advantages that have broad application in agricultural and environmental monitoring. The current GCPs are portable and equipped with an integrated controller, two low-cost GPS modules, a solar panel, a wireless module, and a storage battery, thus simplifying the capture of accurate image data in real-time with a fixed-wing UAV. Results indicate that the current GCPs can be used to improve accuracy in geo-referencing, radiometric calibration, and calibration of crop height estimates from surface models based on structure from motion. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

	abstract = {Today's off-the-shelf, inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging breed of devices that promise to reshape tomorrow's search and rescue landscape. Multiple identical drones can be utilized to achieve more complex tasks when arranged in a swarm formation. In either the single-drone or swarm configuration, these Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery-powered machines can only stay in the air for a brief period of time (usually between 10 and 30 minutes) due to the high power consumption of their motors. For example, drones weighing only 200 to 600 grams can consume between 100-600 Watts. Most search-and-rescue operations last for days, even weeks, rendering these inexpensive drones impractical.A novel charge replenishment mechanism is proposed in this paper that allows a swarm of drones to stay in the air perpetually. This is achieved by employing a fleet of drones much larger than the flying swarm in order to continuously replace and charge energy-depleted drones. The required fleet size for various drone models is calculated analytically and through a simulation. A rule-of-thumb formula is derived based on Queuing Theory and Energy Conversation to confirm the feasibility of this proposal with simulation results. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Analyzing electrical power generation for a wind turbine has associated inaccuracies due to fluctuations in environmental factors, mechanical alterations of wind turbines, and natural disaster. Thus, development of a highly reliable prediction model based on climatic conditions is crucial in forecasting electrical power for proper management of energy demand and supply. This is essential because early forecasting systems will enable an energy supplier to schedule and manage resources efficiently. In this research, we have put forward a novel electrical power prediction model using wavelet and particle swarm optimization based dual-stage adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (dual-stage Wavelet-PSO-ANFIS) for precise estimation of electrical power generation based on climatic factors. The first stage is used to project wind speed based on meteorological data available, while the second stage took the output wind speed prediction to predict electrical power based on actual supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). Furthermore, influence of data dependence on the forecasting accuracy for both stages is analyzed using a subset of data as input to predict the wind power which was also compared with other existing electrical power forecasting techniques. This paper defines the basic framework and the performance evaluation of a dual-stage Wavelet-PSO-ANFIS based electrical power forecasting system using a practical implementation. © 2018 by the authors.

The line 61: For each pixel of each photo they usually capture 5-7 spectral bands, of which 1-2 bands captures part of the NIR wave spectrum, the red and green spectra, and spectrum corresponding color red is divided into several parts, since in case of plant investigation, the so-called Red Edge range is extremely informative (helpful) [7]. The line 67: In this case, the information is captured by a slightly different principle ("Push-broom") – not by capturing a rectangular picture, but one line of pixels, that represent one band spectrum instead and the entire sensor travels with the aircraft in the desired direction, simultaneously covering same pixels with all different possible bands [4, 7, 9]. The line 68: There are also attempts to produce small lightweight camera-type spectrometers [8, 9] (Fig. 3).

The line 151: Published literature on this topic over decade points out that due to specific local characteristics, the previous reliance on first-class kinetic models for the formation of methane of a landfill as a basis for predicting emissions is not precise, it is necessary to replace better, more scientifically based methodology for the following reasons [11–15]: 3.

An orthophoto was generated from the photos using the Trimble Business Center Photogrammetry Module (TBC) software, with an average pixel size (equivalent on the ground - GSD) of 14.4 cm (2015), 3.5 cm (2016) and colored with corresponding RGB value (Fig. 5). The line 202: By comparing visually (Fig. 4), it is evident that the vegetation in the northern part of the territory is livelier, and the slopes of the reservoirs of sediment located in the western part of the territory are changing. The line 213: There are various types of sensors that can be mounted on a UAV to detect greenhouse gas and VOC traces in the lower part of the atmosphere. The most commonly used methods are electrochemical, photoionization, infrared (IR) laser absorption, semiconductor and catalytic detection.

	abstract = {This study focuses on the generation of a high resolution digital surface model (DSM) using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial photography to be utilized in the two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model analyses to investigate the effects of possible flood events in the city centre of Kirsehir, Turkey. One of the most important sources of uncertainty in hydrodynamic models is the resolution of used DSM. Changing DSM resolution can cause serious differences in the simulation results about flood extents, water depths, and flow velocities. Therefore, in complex urban areas, high resolution topographic data is a prerequisite to more accurately simulate the movement of water and thereby to take adequate measures for reducing the most likely flood effects. The use of UAV technologies in the production of topographic data is an appropriate solution for situations when airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or satellite-based remote sensing techniques cannot be implemented due to cost, schedule, and resolution issues. Moreover, terrestrial solutions are much more time-consuming and difficult to apply than UAV-based aerial photography in a complex urban area with intensive vehicle and pedestrian traffic. In this study, the topographic data is obtained by using 2212 geo-referenced images taken on 25 different flight routes over an area of 3.24 km2 using a DJI Matrice 600 UAV-drone equipped with a Zenmuse X5 camera with 15 mm DJI lens. The ground sampling distance of the produced digital surface model is 4.32 cm/pixel, and the localization accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), of the model is 5.1 cm and 12.7 cm for the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively. The results show that high-resolution digital surface models, which can be used as inputs in 2D flood models for preparing flood hazard and flood risk maps, can be produced with relatively low cost and within a short time using UAV imagery. © 2018 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {Under the medium/high speed conditions, the simplified model of articulated heavy vehicle with five degrees of freedom was established, and the integrated control strategy based on timely mode switching was proposed based on the active steering control system of trailer and differential braking control system. According to different medium/high speed conditions, the control modes of integrated control strategy were timely switched to achieve the precision control of articulated heavy vehicle. The optimizing functions corresponding to the control modes were designed to optimize the weight coefficients of control modes by the genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm. According to the optimal weight coefficients, the multiple single control strategies in integrated control strategy were fused and coordinated to achieve the optimal control of articulated heavy vehicle under various modes. The simulation results of multiple control strategies of articulated heavy vehicles were analyzed, and the hardware-in-the-loop test bench was constructed to verify the control effect of integrated control strategy. Research result indicates that the control effect of integrated control strategy is similar to the effect of active steering control strategy of trailer and better than the effect of differential braking control strategy under the normal working condition, and better than the effects of active steering control strategy of trailer and differential braking control strategy under the limit working condition. The maximum slip angle of tractor, the maximum yaw velocity of trailer and the maximum slip angle of trailer are improved by 27.46%, 53.19% and 91.60%, respectively, and the maximum hitch angle is improved by 29.07%, so the integrated control strategy can improve the yaw and jackknife stability of articulated heavy vehicle under the medium/high speed normal conditions. The maximum path deviation of trailer rear is improved by 95.48%, so the integrated control strategy can enormously promote the path following ability of articulated heavy vehicle under the medium/high speed normal conditions. The maximum roll angle of tractor, the maximum roll angle of trailer and the maximum lateral acceleration of trailer are improved by 11.15%, 10.34% and 4.08%, respectively, so the integrated control strategy can improve the roll stability of articulated heavy vehicle under the medium/high speed normal conditions. The integrated control strategy can avoid vehicle rollover under the limit working condition and control the roll angles of tractor and trailer in the stable range of about 25°. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

An active and important research area of cooperative control of multiple UAVs is the formation control. Formation flying is the disciplined flight of two or more aircraft under the command of a flight leader. The main goal is to coordinate a group of UAVs to achieve a desired formation pattern and avoid inter-vehicle collisions at the same time. Formation flight of a team of UAVs has broad applications such as aerial mapping, traffic monitoring, terrain and utilities inspection, search and rescue operations, perimeter planning, disaster monitoring, reconnaissance mission, surveillance etc. Here we propose a Line Of Sight (LOS) guidance based flight formation control strategy for multiple quad rotor UAVs in leader-follower framework. The guidance laws for 2D formation are implemented with the help of LOS angles, between adjacent quadrotors to keep the current quadrotor's position in formation. The full dynamic model of quadrotor incorporating LOS guidance law is considered for designing PID controller and the simulation analysis was done using MATLAB/ Simulink. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With increasingly popular multi-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also referred to as drones, UAV Ad Hoc Networks (UANETs) play an essential role in the realization of coordinating the access of drones to controlled airspace, and providing navigation services between locations in the context of Internet-of-Drones (IoD). Because of the versatility, flexibility, easy installation and relatively small operating expenses of drones, UANETs are more efficient in completing complex tasks in harsh environments, e.g., search and destroy operations, border surveillance, disaster monitoring, etc. However, due to the high mobility, drastically changing network topology, and intermittently connected communication links, existing routing protocols and communication algorithms in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks cannot be directly applied in UANETs. In this paper, we propose a link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing protocol, also called LTA-OLSR, to provide efficient and reliable communication and data transmission in UANETs. A link quality scheme is proposed to differentiate link qualities between a node and its neighbor nodes by using the statistical information of received signal strength indication (RSSI) of received packets. A traffic load scheme is also proposed to assure a light load path by taking account of MAC layer channel contention information and the number of packets stored in the buffer. We evaluate the proposed schemes through extensive simulation experiments using OMNeT++ and compare their performance with the original OLSR and DSR protocols. The simulation results indicate that the proposed routing protocol can be a viable approach in UAV Ad Hoc Networks. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A key component of the Third Offset Strategy proposed by the United States Department of Defense is the use of unmanned autonomous systems to deter potential conflicts. Collaborative autonomy technologies are also being explored by the private sector, which is rapidly pushing towards the deployment of self-driving vehicles. For areas affected by disaster, autonomous drone swarms can assist with search and rescue operations by surveilling large regions quickly without exposing emergency responders to risk prematurely. A substantial amount of progress has been made in distributed sensing research over the last few years. However, simulation results for applications that require complex inter-agent communications have rarely been demonstrated at scale; these simulations are generally executed using tens or hundreds of agents rather than the thousands or tens of thousands envisioned for large autonomous swarms. We address this deficit here by presenting two contributions. First, we extend our previous work on efficient, distributed algorithms for weak radiation source detection to accommodate the use case of surveillance across a very wide area. We then demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms at scale using a parallelized version of the ns-3 discrete event simulator. © 2018 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Large-scale aerial sensing missions can greatly benefit from the perpetual endurance capability provided by high-performance low-altitude solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, today these UAVs suffer from small payload capacity, low energetic margins, and high operational complexity. To tackle these problems, this paper presents four individual technical contributions and integrates them into an existing solar-powered UAV system: First, a lightweight and power-efficient day/night-capable sensing system is discussed. Second, means to optimize the UAV platform to the specific payload and to thereby achieve sufficient energetic margins for day/night flight with payload are presented. Third, existing autonomous launch and landing functionality is extended for solar-powered UAVs. Fourth, as a main contribution an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based autonomous thermal updraft tracking framework is developed. Its novelty is that it allows the end-to-end integration of the thermal-induced roll moment into the estimation process. It is assessed against unscented Kalman filter and particle filter methods in simulation and implemented on the aircraft's low-power autopilot. The complete system is verified during a 26 h search-and-rescue aerial sensing mock-up mission that represents the first-ever fully autonomous perpetual endurance flight of a small solar-powered UAV with a day/night-capable sensing payload. It also represents the first time that solar-electric propulsion and autonomous thermal updraft tracking are combined in flight. In contrast to previous work that has focused on the energetic feasibility of perpetual flight, the individual technical contributions of this paper are considered core functionality to guarantee ease-of-use, effectivity, and reliability in future multiday aerial sensing operations with small solar-powered UAVs. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Drones are becoming popular day by day in professional applications of mapping in the fields ofsurveying, agriculture, mining, structural inspection etc. When it comes to mapping, drones are proven to provideaccurate and very high-resolution products at low cost compared to other traditional remote sensing or surveyingtechniques. Today's consumer grade multirotor drones which cost below 2000 USD for the hardware are capableof using for small area mapping applications. The major issue of multirotors in mapping applications is less flyingtime (approximately 30 mins) so it requires multiple flights and frequent change of batteries, which makes themapping coverage significantly reduced. Using a fixed wing drone for mapping will solve this issue as fixed wingshave high endurance. Considering the advantages of mapping with fixed wing drones, pioneering companies ingeomatics industry such as Sensefly, Trimble, and Leica have introduced survey grade drones to the marketspecifically for mapping purposes. These survey grade drones come as reliable end to end package and with a veryhigh price tag above 15000 USD.This study is focused on building a low-cost custom made fixed wing drone for long range mapping applicationsunder 2000 USD significantly reducing the cost for the hardware. The drone is equipped with GNSS unit andintelligent flight controller, which provide the capability of executing autonomous missions, improving thereliability and adding the crucial safety functions as return to home. Free-sky open source radio system is used forradio link. Propulsion system is optimized in such a way to add proper amount of thrust to the airframe carrying ahigh-resolution camera as the payload. Landing of the drone is a well-known problem for fixed wing category andit is addressed by integrating a parachute with automatic deployment. The drone was successfully tested bymapping 1km2 area in single flight flying over 45 mins. The resulting 3cm resolution map has a verifiedplanimetric accuracy of 34 cm without using GCPs. It was concluded that it is possible to custom build along-range mapping UAV with significantly reduced price yet resulting accurate and high-resolution maps. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018.

Where in their early ver-sions, drones were often controlled remotely by a human operator; they have re-cently become fully or partially autonomous. Today, there is massive growth in the use of drones in a wide range of applications: Military, aerial photography, search and rescue operations, in the field of agriculture, to name a few. The em-bedded software used in autonomous drones must perform in real-time, allowing the drone to interact with its environment. The Internet of drones (IoD) was born when drones were interconnected via a network allowing them to coordinate. Functional size measurement (FSM), a powerful tool for managing software pro-jects, provides an objective and quantitative base for management decisions.

The non-optimal configuration of DGs could severely affect the distribution system operations and control. Hence, the aim of this paper is to analyze the wind data in order to build a mathematical model for power output and pinpoint the optimal location. The overall objective is minimization of power loss reduction in distribution system. The five years of wind data was taken from 24o 44’ 29” North, 67o 35’ 9” East coordinates in Pakistan. The optimal location for these wind farms were pinpointed via particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using standard IEEE 33 radial distribution system. The result reveals that the proposed method helps in improving renewable energy near to load centers, reduce power losses and improve voltage profile of the system. Moreover, the validity and performance of the proposed model were also compared with other optimization algorithms. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

Through Monte-Carlo simulations, we compare the system-wide 5th percentile spectral efficiency (5pSE) while optimizing the performance using a brute force algorithm, a heuristic-based sequential algorithm, and a deep Q-learning algorithm. The autonomous UAVs jointly optimize their location, ICIC parameters, and CRE to maximize 5pSE gains and minimize the outage probability. Our results show that the ICIC technique relying on a simple heuristic outperforms the ICIC technique based on deep Q-learning. Taking advantage of the multiple optimization parameters for interference coordination, the heuristic based ICIC technique can achieve 5pSE values that are reasonably close to those achieved with exhaustive brute force search techniques, at a significantly lower computational complexity. © 2018 IEEE.},

In order to reduce the capacity of the energy storage system and the loss of the battery and make full use of the advantages of the super-capacitor, a game theory-based coordination and optimization control methodology for a wind power-generation and storage system (WPGSS) is presented in this paper. Aiming to maximize the WPGSS's overall profit, the methodology, taking the smoothing effect of the active power, the cost of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), and the earnings of wind power connected to grid into consideration, builds a coordination and optimization control model based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm combined with game theory. In the model, the low-pass filtering signal obtained by the EEMD is used to smooth the fluctuations of wind power output, and the band-pass filtering signal and high-pass filtering signal obtained by the EEMD are used to achieve energy distribution among the HESS. Cooperative game theory is introduced to determine the filter order of the EEMD according to the state of charge (SOC) of the HESS and to achieve the coordination and optimization control of the WPGSS taking the maximization of the WPGSS's overall profit as the game's goal constraint conditions. The genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are adopted to solve the model's optimal solution, and the simulation tests were realized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can provide a theoretical basis for the coordination and optimization control of the WPGSS. © 2017 Chinese Automatic Control Society and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

Given the typical volumes of such businesses it is likely that this poses huge demands on the urban airspace in terms of capacity and conflict resolution. Current UTM concepts devise means to automatically detect and solve conflicts in smaller scales. However, it is yet unanswered to what degree a conflict-free operation of hundreds or thousands of drones occupying the same airspace is possible. In this paper we present a generic simulation framework that can load a given urban airspace with a specified demand or frequency of delivery drones. Based on actual street map data the user can specify a delivery area, a regular or randomized delivery schedule and a number of logistic centers to start from. Random destinations are then picked from the street maps and drones are scheduled to service these destinations. Further, the system analyzes the pre-planned drone schedule for conflicts and tries to resolve these conflicts without delaying individual drones too much. We detail statistics on how responsive the system is to unexpected events like emergency helicopters. The results give first insights, to what degree automatic de-conflicting solutions may work in urban areas. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned vehicle is the term that describes any platform without a human operator on-board. These vehicles can be either tele-operated remotely through a control station, or autonomously driven using on-board sensors and controllers. With the advances in micro and nano electronics, the increase in computing efficiency, and the ability to work in dull, dirty and dangerous environments, modern unmanned vehicles aim at higher levels of autonomy. This is through development of accurate control systems and a high-level environment understanding, in order to perform complex tasks. The main part of autonomous vehicles is the navigation system, along with the supporting subsystems. The navigation system utilizes information from various sensors, in order to estimate the position and orientation of the vehicle, sense the surrounding environment and perform the correct maneuver to achieve its assigned task. Accordingly, this chapter presents a ROS-based architecture for two different unmanned vehicles to be used in civil applications, which are constrained by Size, Weight and Power (SWap). This architecture includes the algorithms for control, localization, perception, planning, communication and cooperation tasks. In addition, in order to validate the robustness of the presented vehicles, different experiments have been carried out in real world applications with two different types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The experiments cover applications in various fields; for instance, search and rescue missions, environment exploration, transportation and inspection. The obtained results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and validates its functionality on actual platforms. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {We consider a special type of Delay Tolerant Network (DTN), called “Local-Ferry-based network” (LFN), which enables communication among multiple nodes distributed over a geographic terrain. LFN utilizes controllable special purpose vehicles called “pigeons” to transfer messages among neighboring nodes: some (or all) nodes own these message ferries (a.k.a. pigeons), which help in establishing communication links among local nodes, cumulatively setting up the whole network. One research challenge is to schedule the pigeon movement between local nodes (i.e., deciding the pigeon’s visiting sequence of the local nodes) to achieve good networking performance (e.g., message delay). Solving this research challenge poses promise for many exciting applications, such as using drones to enable communication among segregated regions in disaster recovery, to augment/connect in-situ IoT deployments, and more. In this paper, we address the above challenge whereas we contribute the following. First, we analyze what it takes to optimize the scheduling algorithm for a pigeon. Second, using the above results we design multiple variants of scheduling algorithms, and we compare their performance with the theoretical optimal delay and with the state-of-the-art algorithms through simulation experiments. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show the efficacy of our solution. For instance, our best scheduling algorithm achieves (within 5% margin) the theoretical optimal (per-hop) message delay. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Emergency response teams are charged with ensuring citizen safety from life-threatening events such as structural fires, vehicle accidents, and hazardous material spills. While managing such events is dangerous, the release of hazardous materials, such as toxic chemicals, into the atmosphere is particularly challenging. Upon arrival at a scene, response teams must quickly identify the hazardous substance and the contaminated area to limit exposure to nearby population centers. For airborne toxins, this assessment is complicated by environmental conditions, such as changes in wind speed and direction that can cause hazardous, aerial plumes to move dynamically. Without a way to dynamically monitor and assess atmospheric conditions during these events, response teams must conservatively predict the extent of the contaminated area and then orchestrate evacuations and reroute traffic to ensure the safety of nearby populations. In this paper, we propose outfitting swarms of drones with Internet of Things (IoT) sensor platforms to enable dynamic tracking of hazardous aerial plumes. Augmenting drones with sensors enables emergency response teams to maintain safe distances during hazard identification, minimizing first response team exposure. Additionally, we integrate sensor-based particulate detection with autonomous drone flight control providing the capability to dynamically identify and track the boundaries of aerial plumes in real time. This enables first responders to visually identify plume movement and better predict and isolate the impact area. We describe the composition of our prototype IoT-enhanced drone system and describe our initial evaluations. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) and big data are both important technologies that are promoting the development of the current society and economy. The key point of the modern agriculture is to upgrade traditional industries by using information technology, to realize the production, management and decision by using data and online service. Agricultural park informationization construction is important starting point of structural reforms for the supply side under the strategy of rural rejuvenation. Taking the agricultural park digital management as an example, in order to solve the difficulties of information resource insufficient and management model needs to be improved, the digital management technology was put forward, which is suitable for small scale agriculture park. By obtaining datas through the approaches such as internet of things, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and scientific research collaboration, a panoramic geographic information system (GIS) digital cloud service systems with 4 core functions was designed. Firstly, the high frequency concurrent data access framework for MySQL database system, which can scatter the pressure from single storage node to more others, was designed to receive and save the IoT monitoring data with low energy cost and highly reliable extension, the traditional storage mechanism was replaced by unified storage strategy through the peer to peer routing algorithms, which specifying the site and direction of every records, so as to ensure the safety and stability of the data storage system in the data center. Secondly, the park holographic information management system was designed, which can greatly enhance the real scene effect of 2D map from multiple aspects of 3D view, can trigger the query event like IoT monitoring data query and analysis based on the accurate conversion of the coordinates between panoramic image and panoramic hemisphere, can realize 3D management with much lower cost than traditional 3D modeling by processing UAVs images and setting active points. Thirdly, in order to meet the urgent need of deep mining analysis of IoT monitoring, the online data mining analysis model,was designed, which can reduce the dimension of IoT monitoring data based on optimizing the parameters in ARIMA (p, d, q) model based on differentiation process and the stability of analyzed datas, and other models such as AR (p), MA (q) and ARMA (p, q) under the premise were also consisted. Finally, in order to meet the urgent requirements of result analyz of variety breeding and cultivation pattern test under background of resources endowment, the collaborative analysis of experimental datas was researched and developed to solve the interdisciplinary analysis problems between analysts and agricultural technology personnel. On the basis of all above, because of the advantages of light weighted technology architecture and strong extensibility of digital resources integration pattern for the cloud service system of digital agricultural park, the digital system for agricultural park based on panorama GIS can not only upgrade the level of precise agricultural production and management by the core digital data services based on the technologies of IoT and panorama GIS, but also can provide technical support to achieve "high quality, high efficiency, ecology, safety" for agriculture production. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Ensuring ubiquitous mission-critical public safety communications (PSC) to all the first responders in the public safety network is crucial at an emergency site. Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has received extensive interest for PSC to fill the coverage holes and establish reliable connectivity. The UAVs can be deployed as unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) as part of a heterogeneous network (HetNet) PSC infrastructure. In this paper, we design a PSC LTE-Advanced HetNet for different path loss models and deployment mechanism for UABSs. We enhance the system-wide spectral efficiency (SE) of this PSC HetNet by apply cell range expansion (CRE) to UABSs and mitigating the inter-cell interference arising in the HetNet by applying 3GPP Release-10 enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) and 3GPP Release-11 further-enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (FeICIC). Through Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the system-wide fifth percentile SE when UABSs are deployed on a hexagonal grid and when their locations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, while also jointly optimizing the CRE and the inter-cell interference coordination parameters. Our results show that at optimized UABS locations, reduced power subframes defined in 3GPP Release-11 can provide considerably better fifth percentile SE than the 3GPP Release-10 with almost blank subframes (eICIC). © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multirotor agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are perceived as one of the key enablers for precision agriculture (PA) in near future. UAVs capture images with much higher resolution compared to satellites and airplanes because of the low altitude remote sensing (≤ 400 ft above ground level in the USA). UAVs also provide better operational and temporal flexibility to react quickly to undesirable weather events. The sensitivity of the image capturing devices (thermal and multispectral) to exhaust gases makes gas powered UAVs practically unusable for PA's scouting or sensing tasks. Therefore, agricultural UAVs are typically electric powered using lithiumion polymer (Li-Po) batteries. However, the endurance of Li-Po battery pack imposes severe constraints on the operational time span of an electric UAV during an agricultural mission. Hence, optimal path planning is critical for maximizing farm field area coverage and minimizing operational cost for image acquisition per flight. Our research contribution focuses on the trajectory optimization of multirotor UAVs in multi-phase optimal control framework with field area coverage and energy as two separate performance indexes to be maximized and minimized respectively. The mathematical relationship between the thrust produced and power consumed by a UAV is derived using momentum theory for the climb, cruise, and descent phases. Finally, the two optimal control problems formulated are numerically solved using pseudospectral method for an actual UAV product: DJI Phantom 4.0 quadcopter. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is favored by the industry to search and locate the lost personss in mountains and the trapped personss in earthquakes, fires and other disasters because it is not limited by the obstruction on the ground. Currently, however, a UAV always searches and locates the targets along a fixed flight path, which consumes more time and has lower accuracy. This kind of method can only provide a rough position estimation. Guideloc takes the UAVs GPS coordinates as the location information of the target and the genetic algorithm (GA) is used for path planning in order to shorten the flight path to improve the search efficiency and obtain a good result. But its performance still has room for improvement. In this paper, the path optimization algorithm used in Guideloc was further discussed and studied, and then a 2-OptACO method was proposed. The method is based on the 2-opt algorithm to improve the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) and is applied to optimize the UAVs path for search and rescue. The simulation results show that the 2-OptACO method has a faster convergence rate than the GA and ACO. It can obtain a better global optimal solution. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of changes in population in China, the trend of labor shortage for agricultural production has grown and will continue in future. Acceleration of agricultural mechanization has been proposed as one developmental strategy at the national level in support of steady and sustainable development of agriculture in China. In alignment with this national developmental plan, the use of UAVs for pesticide application contributes to the advancement of plant protection mechanization by providing improved ability to apply pesticide in a time sensitive manner with enhanced safety and efficiency. In the process of the rapid and swift development of agricultural UAVs for pesticide application, there are many opportunities and challenges. Several advantages and challenges relevant to further development of UAV spraying technology were discussed. Using UAVs for pesticide application offers attractive advantages over traditional spray operations. Low-volume pesticide application using agricultural drones at low flight altitudes has been implemented in corn and paddy fields as well as on hill farms in China. The potential ease of deployment of UAVs, particularly for spraying in small fields or complex geographic terrain that are not easily accessible by people or ground plant-protection machinery, adds distinct value to using UAVs. Limitations of payload and battery life of small UAVs are not a major barrier when using a UAV to spray a small patch of farmland that is typical in many regions of China. But market occupancy for UAV pesticide application will favor UAVs that cannot only provide greater lift and longer flight endurance, but also can offer exceptionally durable and rugged designs for operations under extreme agriculture conditions. Various field trials and evaluations have proved that the actual working effect of UAVs' pesticide application is a feasible practice in China. Given the novelty and complexity of UAV technology, research and development of UAV-based application technology takes priority. Spraying low-volume pesticide using UAVs at low flight altitude differs from either conventional manned aerial application or ground equipment based application, and thus a wide variety of spray parameters warrants further investigation. Currently, there is a lack of any existing pesticide application technology that is well-suited for low volume spraying pesticides using agricultural UAVs in China. Spray system configurations equipped on UAVs have not yet been optimized to complement spray patterns based on the proper nozzle selection, spray tank design, and pesticide handling systems. Also, there are neither industrial standards nor sufficient scientific understanding that can provide sound guidance to determine appropriate operation parameters used in UAV spraying as influenced by weather and land conditions. Assessment of UAV spray technology in field trials for spray quality, efficacy, and safety will influence the forward progress of UAV deployment considerably. Penetration of crop canopies, droplet deposition and coverage, together with spray drift control are priorities to evaluate the efficiency and efficacy of crop protection products applied through UAVs. Advanced flight control systems, sensing systems, and software platforms for mission planning are needed to achieve flight stability and accuracy. Spray aerodynamics of small single or multi-rotor UAVs and the interactions with environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, still need to be clearly understood for better engineering design UAV airframe designated for pesticide applications. Otherwise, spray drift beyond the targeted area can cause severe damage to adjacent crops and injuries to spray operators. A big challenge, especially, when spraying herbicides, will be minimizing spray drift causing damage to a sensitive crop near the sprayed area. Risk assessments on driftable spray droplets based on field measurements and implementation of drift-reduction-technology are important aspects to consider in developing the UAV pesticide application technology. © 2018 Research Information Ltd.

	abstract = {While there have been important advances within wireless communication technology, the provision of communication support during disaster relief activities remains an open issue. The literature in disaster research reports several major restrictions to conducting first response activities in urban areas, given the limitations of telephone networks and radio systems to provide digital communication in the field. In search-and-rescue operations, the communication requirements are increased, since the first responders need to rely on real-time and reliable communication to perform their activities and coordinate their efforts with other teams. Therefore, these limitations open the door to improvisation during disaster relief efforts. In this paper, we argue that flying ad-hoc networks can provide the communication support needed in these scenarios, and propose a new solution towards that goal. The proposal involves the use of flying witness units, implemented using drones, that act as communication gateways between first responders working at different locations of the affected area. The proposal is named the Flying Real-Time Network, and its feasibility to provide communication in a disaster scenario is shown by presenting both a real-time schedulability analysis of message delivery, as well as simulations of the communication support in a physical scenario inspired by a real incident. The obtained results were highly positive and consistent, therefore this proposal represents a step forward towards the solution of this open issue. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Search and rescue missions and surveillance require finding targets in a large area. These tasks often use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with cameras to detect and move towards a target. However, common UAV approaches make two simplifying assumptions. First, they assume that observations made from different heights are deterministically correct. In practice, observations are noisy, with the noise increasing as the height used for observations increases. Second, they assume that a motion command executes correctly, which may not happen due to wind and other environmental factors. To address these, we propose a sequential algorithm that determines actions in real time based on observations, using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Our formulation handles both observations and motion uncertainty and errors. We run offline simulations and learn a policy. This policy is run on a UAV to find the target efficiently. We employ a novel compact formulation to represent the coordinates of the drone relative to the target coordinates. Our POMDP policy finds the target up to 3.4 times faster when compared to a heuristic policy. © 2017 IEEE.},

These UAVs can be deployed as unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) as part of the HetNet infrastructure. In this article, we explore the role of agile UABSs in LTE-Advanced HetNets by applying 3GPP Release-11 further-enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (Fe-ICIC) and cell range expansion (CRE) techniques. Through simulations, we compare the system-wide 5th percentile spectral efficiency (SE) when UABSs are deployed in a hexagonal grid and when their locations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, while also jointly optimizing the CRE and the FeICIC parameters. Our simulation results show that at optimized UABS locations, the 3GPP Release-11 FeICIC with reduced power subframes can provide considerably better 5th percentile SE than the 3GPP Release-10 with almost blank subframes. © 2017 IEEE.},

Multi-agent architectures are commonly used for autonomous control of unmanned vehicles. Existing multi-robot architectures for unmanned aerial and ground robots are generally mission and platform oriented. Collision avoidance, path-planning and tracking are some of the fundamental requirements for autonomous operation of unmanned robots. Though aerial and ground vehicles operate differently, the algorithms for obstacle avoidance, path-planning and path-tracking can be generalized. Service Oriented Interoperable Framework for Robot Autonomy (SOIFRA) proposed in this work is an interoperable multi-agent framework focused on generalizing platform independent algorithms for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. SOIFRA is behavior-based, modular and interoperable across unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. SOIFRA provides collision avoidance, and, path-planning and tracking behaviors for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. Vector Directed Path-Generation and Tracking (VDPGT), a vector-based algorithm for real-time path-generation and tracking, is proposed in this work. VDPGT dynamically adopts the shortest path to the destination while minimizing the tracking error. Collision avoidance is performed utilizing Hough transform, Canny contour, Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow algorithm and expansion of object-based time-to-contact estimation. Simulation and experimental results from Turtlebot and AR Drone show that VDPGT can dynamically generate and track paths, and SOIFRA is interoperable across multiple robotic platforms. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The proposed MAS enables information exchange required for the application of demand-side management (DSM) strategy and has five agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical load agent (LA), charging/refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA). The GA is responsible for managing the distributed energy resources of the microgrid. The LA aggregates the residential electrical loads. The SA is responsible for charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and refilling of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). The CA coordinates the interactions between the field level agents. The DA finds the optimal sizes of the system's components by minimizing the total cost of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

Such swarm-bots are being increasingly touted to support various indoor surveillance, hazard detection, and search and rescue missions. This paper presents the conceptual design, fabrication, and testing of a new cm-scale wheeled swarm-bot. Simulated investigation of a simple particle-swarm-inspired approach to coordinated path planning for these swarm-bots is also presented. The swarm bot is developed around a modular platform, comprising snap-on (3D printed) structural components, a stepper-motor actuated wheel system, a Raspberry Pi computing node, a wireless radio module, a Lipo battery, and proximity sensors; all components are readily detachable, thereby allowing reconfiguration flexibility. Through three design generations, a stable prototype offering >20cm/s speed and ∼50 min endurance, was developed, assembled and tested. A virtual simulated environment is developed by combining MATLAB-based modules and a V-Rep environment, in order to simulate the coordinated operation of these swarm-bots. A 78% rate of success in completing target (light source) search missions was observed during the numerical experiments, and performance robustness was observed to improve with increasing swarm size.

	abstract = {In this work, a swarm behaviour for multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployment will be presented. The main contribution of this behaviour is the use of a virtual device for quantitative sematectonic stigmergy providing more adaptable behaviours in complex environments. It is a fault tolerant highly robust behaviour that does not require prior information of the area to be covered, or to assume the existence of any kind of information signals (GPS, mobile communication networks . . .), taking into account the specific features of UAVs. This behaviour will be oriented towards emergency tasks. Their main goal will be to cover an area of the environment for later creating an ad-hoc communication network, that can be used to establish communications inside this zone. Although there are several papers on robotic deployment it is more difficult to find applications with UAV systems, mainly because of the existence of various problems that must be overcome including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities and low flight endurance. In addition, those behaviours designed for UAVs often have significant limitations on their ability to be used in real tasks, because they assume specific features, not easily applicable in a general way. Firstly, in this article the characteristics of the simulation environment will be presented. Secondly, a microscopic model for deployment and creation of ad-hoc networks, that implicitly includes stigmergy features, will be shown. Then, the overall swarm behaviour will be modeled, providing a macroscopic model of this behaviour. This model can accurately predict the number of agents needed to cover an area as well as the time required for the deployment process. An experimental analysis through simulation will be carried out in order to verify our models. In this analysis the influence of both the complexity of the environment and the stigmergy system will be discussed, given the data obtained in the simulation. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic models will be compared verifying the number of predicted individuals for each state regarding the simulation. © 2018 Aznar et al.

	abstract = {Precise, robust, and consistent localization is an important subject in many areas of science such as vision-based control, path planning, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). To estimate the pose of a platform, sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), global positioning system (GPS), and cameras are commonly employed. Each of these sensors has their strengths and weaknesses. Sensor fusion is a known approach that combines the data measured by different sensors to achieve a more accurate or complete pose estimation and to cope with sensor outages. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation algorithm is presented for a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown GPS-denied environment. A UAV can be fully localized by three position coordinates and three orientation angles. The proposed algorithm fuses the data from an IMU, a camera, and a two-dimensional (2D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) using extended Kalman filter (EKF) to achieve accurate localization. Among the employed sensors, LiDAR has not received proper attention in the past; mostly because a two-dimensional (2D) LiDAR can only provide pose estimation in its scanning plane, and thus, it cannot obtain a full pose estimation in a 3D environment. A novel method is introduced in this paper that employs a 2D LiDAR to improve the full 3D pose estimation accuracy acquired from an IMU and a camera, and it is shown that this method can significantly improve the precision of the localization algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated and justified by simulation and real world experiments. Copyright © 2017 by ASME.},

	abstract = {It is irrefutable that the use of Unmanned Airborne Vehicle Systems (UAVs) in agricultural tasks and on the analysis of health and vegetative conditions represents a powerful tool in modern agriculture. To contribute to the growth of the agriculture economic sector a seeder to be coupled to any type of UAV was previously developed and designed by the authors. This seeder allows for the deposition of seeds with positional accuracy, i.e., seeds are accurately deposited at pre-established distances between plants [1]. This work aims at analyzing the aerodynamic behavior of UAV/Seeder assembly to determine the suitable inclination-among 0°, 15°and 30°- for its takeoff and for its motion during the seeding operation and, in turn, to define the suitable flight plan that increases the batteries autonomy. For this the ANSYS® FLUENT computational tool was used to simulate a wind tunnel which has as principle the Navier-Stokes differential equations, that designates the fluid flow around the UAV/Seeder assembly. The aerodynamic results demonstrated that for take-off the UAV inclination of 30°is the aerodynamically most favorable position due to the lower aerodynamic drag during the climb. Concerning flying motion during the seeding procedure the UAV inclination of 0°is that which leads to lower UAV/Seeder frontal area and drag coefficient. © 2017 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Communication during emergency situations is crucial to saving lives. Rescue workers at an emergency scene need to be able to coordinate and communicate effectively. Despite the vast improvements in personal communication networks, public safety communication has been lacking. A recent bill from Congress and the FCC has provided the groundwork for the creation of a nationwide broadband public safety communication network. This advancement in technology will allow rescue workers to receive critical information updates in all forms of media (e.g., video, text and voice). A problem arises when communication tower is destroyed; this network will no longer function for that area. A solution must be created to temporarily cover the partially or completely destroyed networks or towers assigned area to restore their connectivity and to connect them to the global network. In this paper, we design an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network that can be used to route broadband data similar to a communication tower for when the main network is unusable. Using global geolocation map, the optimal/sufficient number of UAVs can be sent out quickly to the geolocation of a destroyed tower and route traffic accordingly. UAVs also have the advantage of being airborne, allowing for better line of sight with ground users. Simulation results show that the proposed design has better performance in terms of channel capacity and throughput when signal strength is lower. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There have been increased interests in High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which operates in the stratosphere with duration of several days (or months) without landing. It is expected that HALE UAV can be utilized for various purposes include both military and civil applications. Among various applications, the focus of this paper is in the application of HALE UAV on the improvement of Global Positioning System (GPS) using pseudolite, particularly in cases of multi-purpose operations of HALE UAV. The trajectory of HALE UAV can be designed only for the navigation application, but it also can be designed for other purposes. For instance, HALE UAV flies in high altitude around the urban area for the operation of environmental observation, and it also broadcasts signals like that of GPS satellite at the same time. In the aspect of navigation, this can increase the availability of positioning and improving the Dilution of Precision (DOP) particularly for GPS signal-blocked area such as shadowed region by tall buildings. For these multipurpose operations, simulations are performed to analyze the increased navigation performance in the aspect of satellite visibility and DOPs of users in urban canyon. For simulations, flight trajectories of HALE UAV considering the environments of stratosphere and operational characteristics of solar powered HALE UAV, and real geographical buildings data in Seoul are considered. The simulation results display that HALE UAV can follow the designed trajectory in some measure even when the flight profile of HALE UAV and the wind of stratosphere are considered. With properly generated trajectories of HALE UAV, the results display that pseudolite equipped HALE UAV has its potentiality in navigation degraded situations increasing the availability of satellite navigation system.},

The wind-hydro-thermal coordinated dispatch aims to minimise the total fuel costs of coal-fired thermal power units while satisfying all kinds of operating constraints. To better handle the random variables in the constraints introduced by wind power and load demand during analysis, a probabilistic analytical model is employed to describe the uncertainty of wind farm power output first; moreover, then an improved convolution method is applied to calculate the total stochastic power consisting of load demand and power output of wind farm. The two-stage stochastic linear programming method and stochastic chance constraints are employed to further form a new deterministic objective function with penalty items taken into account. An enhanced particle swarm optimisation method is applied in the solution of the proposed model. Finally, the simulations are performed on a 6-bus test system and a real-sized China power grid test system to investigate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed optimisation strategy. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

	abstract = {According to multi-area operations, a kind of overall route planning algorithm for plant protection UAVs was developed in order to reduce flight distance in multi-area operations and operating sequence of each area was reasonable allocation to improve operational efficiency and reduce energy consumption of the UAVs. The algorithm was divided into three parts, namely, single area route planning, operating sequences of areas and dispatching route planning among areas. After analyzing a variety of covering operation modes in aspects of operation distance, extra coverage and missed coverage, the UAVs operation mode in single area was determined. Optimized operation sequences of areas were planned based on genetic algorithm and traveling salesman problem (TSP). Dispatching routes among areas were planned based on improved genetic algorithm with binary coding, finally the overall route planning algorithm was achieved. The simulation was performed in an operation of five different irregular areas, numbers of each area were set as A, B, C, D and E. Operation route of each area was planned by using the previously proposed algorithm of route planning algorithm based on operation path angle in irregular, achieving operation start point, end point and node point coordinates of each area. Operation sequences of areas were achieved based on genetic algorithm and TSP, dispatching routes among areas were planned based on the improved genetic algorithm, of which the code was a random five-digit binary sequence, each digit represented arrangement of start point and end point of each area. The simulation result proved feasibility of the multi-area route planning algorithm. Nowadays, unmanned operations becomes trend, this multi-area route planning algorithm not only saves manpower required by route planning, but also makes operation management easier, and it is suitable for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles and can be widely used in the area of precision agriculture. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

The suggested hybrid mechanism applied with appropriate regularization constraints speeds up the convergence of PSO. The estimated original sparse signal is also recovered with great precision. Simulation results show that the signal estimated with PSO-SSF combination outperforms the signal recovery through PSO, SSF and parallel coordinate descent (PCD) methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

	abstract = {The use of small scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and their formation flight is a field that has been greatly gaining popularity for the past decade or so. UAVs today are being integrated in various industries such as oil & gas, agriculture, security, filming, and landscaping just to name a few. However, UAVs are still not used extensively due to the various limitations imposed when using a single UAV. Such limitations include and are not limited to load tolerance, battery life, load area, failure, and speed of data acquisition. Formation flight is the coordinated flight of UAVs towards achieving a certain goal. This is achieved through the use of a formation controller which works at coupling UAV states and maintaining a certain formation structure. The use of formation flight allows for overcoming most of the limitations imposed when using single UAVs. This opens the door for enhancing the effectiveness of using UAVs to perform tasks in practical life situations. Many researchers have been nvestigating and developing the theory behind performing a uccessful and robust formation flight controller for various types of UAVs, such as rotary wings, fixed wings, flapping wings, and blimps. This chapter offers a survey of the development and applications of the various types of UAVs being used in literature today, their formation flight, and the components necessary to design a robust formation flight. The chapter also contains a review of the development and different types of formation flight schemes of small scale UAVs (virtual structure, leader-follower, behavioral). Moreover it discusses the various configurations of controllers (centralized, decentralized, hierarchal) that have been used in literature to achieve that. The other components necessary for a robust formation flight which are reviewed involve path planning, trajectory generation, collision avoidance, and fault tolerance. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {SINS/BD2/GPS/CNS is a usable integrated scheme which is suitable for the navigation system of the highaltitude long-endurance solar-powered UAV. The normal fault-tolerant integrated navigation algorithm can only detect the single fault and the precision deteriorates in faulty operations. To solve these problems, a fault-tolerant integrated navigation algorithm is proposed using chi-square test with two state propagators (TSPCST) and the fuzzy adaptive filter (FAF). First, with the application of the TSPCST in the structure of the federal Kalman filter, the algorithm can detect multiple types of measurement faults at the same time. Then, these two state propagators are alternatively reset in a fixed period with the high precision navigation information provided by the FAF. By this method, the risk of using a contaminated data in the system is avoided. Furthermore, the FAF utilizes the fault context variables obtained by the TSPCST to define the fuzzy validity domains of each subsystem. By this method, the detection threshold is blurred to make up the drawback that it is difficult for the conventional algorithm with the fixed detection threshold to choose the threshold. Finally, the algorithm can process the failures adaptively through calculating the information distribution factor. Simulation results show that the performance of this algorithm is better than the conventional ones with the fixed detection threshold. © 2016, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

	abstract = {To realize the sustainable development, the manufactories/plants must have efficient management/schedule plan and control methods for systems from the aspects of economy, environment and social community. The optimization algorithms are necessary to obtain the optimal or sub-optimal solutions for the manufactories/plants. As one of the most important systems, the power systems play very important role in world. Most of the generators consume the natural resources such as coal, gas, petrol and nuclear materials, and it is very important that the generators do not waste the natural resources and meet the needs of human beings. Hence it is very important to get an optimal or acceptable sub-optimal dynamical economic dispatch, which determines the optimal generation scheme to meet the predicted load demand over a time horizon satisfying the constraint such as ramp-rate limits of generators between time intervals, for a power system which may involve conventional generators and some other alternate sources (solar, wind) of energy. Since power systems are very complicated and there are many constraints, it is difficult to find the optimal solution(s) based on the classical mathematical methods. In the past several decades, there are many kinds of evolutionary optimization algorithms which have been proposed. As one of the nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and its variants have shown its advantages in many applications. In this paper we propose a random dimension velocity updated PSO. Simulations are used to test the proposed PSO based several benchmark functions and then the proposed PSO is applied to the dynamic economic dispatch problems of power system. All the simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2016},

In order to provide both frequency stabilization and SOC schedule near optimal performance within the whole operating regions, a multiple-input multiple-output model predictive control (MIMO-MPC) is employed for the coordination of LFC and EV controllers. The MIMO-MPC is an effective model- based prediction which calculates future control signals by an optimization of quadratic programming based on the plant model, past manipulate, measured disturbance, and control signals. By optimizing the input and output weights of the MIMO-MPC using particle swarm optimization (PSO), the optimal MIMO-MPC for simultaneous control of the LFC and EVs, is able to stabilize the frequency fluctuation and maintain the desired battery SOC at the certain time, effectively. Simulation study in a two-area interconnected power system with wind farms shows the effectiveness of the proposed MIMO-MPC over the proportional integral (PI) controller and the decentralized vehicle to grid control (DVC) controller. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) offer many advantages for various types of mission including search and rescue and ordnance disposal. They significantly reduce the threat to human. These vehicles equipped with vision system and robotic arms can be autonomously routed to identify victims, targets, and threats and for ordnance disposal. However, their operation in urban environment and terrains poses unique challenges such as visibility constraints posed by high-rise buildings and unreliable GPS data in urban environments or in the terrains. This makes autonomous navigation of these vehicles difficult. Also, since they operate in the ground, the field of view they provide is limited. Therefor unamend aerial vehicle (UAV)-guided navigation of these vehicles is becoming increasingly important as the UAVs provide better and exocentric views. A typical scenario is for search and rescue missions where a UAV equipped with an onboard vision system identifies a victim on the ground and determines the victim's location and provides the UGV with the location of the target. The UAV then guides the UGV to the area while continuously monitoring and sharing the environment with the UGV and increasing its situational awareness. The UGV provides on-ground evaluation and assessment and delivers a rescue package to the victim. This paper presents the research being done at Cal Poly Pomona on the UAV-guided navigation of a UGV for search and rescue type missions. In our research, a UGV is provided with a series of waypoints or coordinates to follow based on the target location identified by the UAV based vision system. The UAV flies a predefined flight path autonomously using an autopilot. The path is determined by the mission boundary. The main problem of the UGV is to follow the waypoints, find the path and keep itself on path. In order to follow the waypoints, the correct robot pose, odometry, and orientation has to be estimated. A camera onboard the UGV constantly takes images to analyze the road condition. The UGV is also equipped with a laser scanner and sonars for obstacle detection. The vision module classifies images into drivable and non-drivable regions and thus identifies the path to follow. The paper will show the simulation and experimental results.},

	abstract = {The growing use of robotics in the maritime domain is about to pose questions on legal fallouts of autonomous systems to the international community. Unmanned maritime systems (UMS) such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are being increasingly employed for environmental and scientific studies. Applications of not weaponized robotic platforms for maritime security, littoral protection, antisubmarine warfare, and mine countermeasures are being investigated quite successfully both by civilian and military bodies. And more capabilities are expected to be developed for the archaeological surveys and Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. These growing spread and interest are due to the fact that, among the new maritime technologies, UMS are some of the most energy-efficient ones since they are usually equipped with small engines or they can even fly in the water without any propulsion but just using waves and currents as for example gliders do. Nevertheless the regulatory framework is lying far away from the technological fast advancement. Current experimental operations are forced to be always conducted under special authorisations and area clearances. But what is stopping the authorities to rule the use of these tools? The fact is that the issue of responsibility and liability for autonomous robots is difficult to be solved, even for not weaponized systems. Differently from aerial drones, whose civil use have been recently regulated in most countries, including the United States and the European Union, referring to pilot liability, unmanned vehicles are, as said, 'un-manned', without man in the loop or with men even far from remote control, being in a domain where radio connections are limited to submerging windows and control is transferred to software programming. This makes the application of personal responsibility challenging, while indeed undermining basics principles to which the law of the sea applies, for example, in the area of navigation safety: could UMS be defined as vessels according to international conventions or are they to be considered something different? What's the real degree of independence encompassed within the term autonomy? These thoughts lead to include into consideration also manned and remotely operated vessels, whose wire connection to human operators is clearer but which pose in any case questions on legal status. This paper is devoted to identify the legal blanks in the field and analyse the applicability to UMS of maritime legal regimes and present regulations at international level. First of all, particular attention will be paid in trying to ascertain the status of such devices in order to reach a categorization of them under a maritime law perspective. Secondly, the article will analyse the juridical implications deriving from the various maritime zones as defined by the law of the sea towards the transit, the use and the operation of UMS. Going into details, the circulation of the aforesaid instruments is going to be examined in the light of the 'innocent passage' institution. Lastly, the research will be focused on the liability arising from the employment of these systems in case of collision with other vessels, cultural and natural assets, private goods, or other harbour infrastructures and, more in general, where a violation of the navigational rules against casualties could be recognised. In particular, the study will mainly involve the IMO Conventions consecrated to safety or security measures and environmental issues. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Reconfigurable systems are systems that can be transformed into different configurations, to provide different functionality or to adapt to different operating environment. In this paper, we describe the preliminary design process and construction of a first generation modular Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is reconfigurable offline. The modules of this reconfigurable UAV platform can be assembled to form a quad-rotor UAV (QR-UAV) configuration or a fixed-wing UAV (FW-UAV) configuration, respectively providing VTOL/hovering capabilities and long-endurance/range capabilities. The goal of this design effort is to develop, fabricate, and flight-test a modular and reconfigurable UAV platform that can be used by different types of field personnel – from wildfire firefighters, to emergency responders and-post-disaster search and rescue teams. Hence, diverse functionality was deemed necessary along with strict maximum weight/volume specifications (backpack-carry-able modules) and the ability to be assembled/disassembled in a matter of minutes. The overall design and the first generation prototype is derived from an original conceptual design performed using modular product platform planning concepts. The UAV modules were defined in terms of 15 design variables, and the conceptual design optimization was performed using the mixed-discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The QR configuration in this UAV comprises four ducted rotors and a central pod housing all the required electronics, including the battery. In addition to all the modules in the QR configuration, the FW configuration includes a multi-section flying wing with vertical and horizontal stabilizers, where the ducted rotors are mounted on the bottom (1st generation concept) or the top (2nd generation concept) of the wing. In developing the detailed design, it was conceived that the majority of the UAV would be fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques. The preliminary design/fabrication/flight-testing processes has now provided us with new constraints that would be implemented in the overall design optimization of the next generation of this reconfigurable UAV platform. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The DSS simulates disasters and plans shipments of relief goods via transfer points to demand points in the affected area. This enables decision-makers to analyze the last-mile distribution of goods by scheduling and routing trucks, off-road as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. Roads which are closed or opened during a disaster are considered allowing a dynamic adaptation to real world conditions and a comprehensive analysis over a rolling time-horizon. A mixed-integer problem formulation, an agent-based simulation, a heuristic-based scheduling and routing procedure as well as a Tabu Search metaheuristic are applied to analyze the given decision problem. Coordination between private and relief organization shows to be especially beneficial if time-losses resulting from closed roads are high and substantial unexpected demand occurs. Furthermore, results highlight the importance of selecting suitable transfer points and the potential of simulation and optimization based DSSs to improve disaster relief distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Grid-connection of wind farm makes trouble for active power dispatching of power grid. To coordinate operational reliability and economy of power grid with the benefit of wind power utilization, a 24-point peak load regulation margin index, which determines positive and negative spinning reserve in power grid and the wind power sent to power grid, is put forward and a coordinated optimal dispatching model under grid-connection of wind farm is proposed. In the proposed model, the minimized total operation cost is taken as the objective, in which the running cost of thermal- and hydro-power generation, the penalty cost due to wind power curtailment and the penalty cost of system reserve capacity are contained. The proposed model is validated by the results of the simulation based on a certain regional power grid containing three wind farms, and the priority list method and the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used in the simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed index and optimal model offer an effective approach to solve grid-connection of wind farms. ©, 2015, Power System Technology Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {The main aim of Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch is to minimize both the operating fuel cost and emission level simultaneously while satisfying the operational constraints and load demand. An important criterion in power system operation is to meet the power demand at minimum fuel cost using an optimal mix of different power plants. The day ahead scheduling of generating units in the power system are feasible and consistent with the long term planning. This problem is a multi-objective optimization approach in which total electrical power generation costs and combustion emissions are simultaneously minimized over the scheduling time. To find the optimum emission dispatch, optimum fuel cost, best compromising emission and fuel cost, a stochastic approach of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used here. A stochastic optimization model for dynamic economic dispatch of wind-thermal power system is established to minimize the comprehensive operation expected cost. By using a price penalty factor approach the multi-objective CEED problem is changed to a single objective function. The effects of wind power on overall emission are also investigated here. The proposed model helps operator to make decisions on the quantity of power and reserve that must be put up for generation in each of the unit for the respective hour and also to schedule generators in order to minimize power generation costs with environmental considerations. The proposed approach can provide better solutions than other stochastic search algorithms in the literature. The scheduling can be extended with solar and storages. The IEEE 30 bus system has been taken for the simulation work of the proposed method with wind farms. © International Science Press.},

	abstract = {The application of DC power modulation of DC transmission lines can effectively suppress the phenomenon of inter-area low frequency oscillation between AC and DC interconnected grids. But in multi-infeed AC/DC transmission power system, the role of DC modulation is weakened due to the lack of mutual coordination. In order to improve the stability of the operation of the overall interconnected system, in this paper a control strategy is proposed to apply the improved Prony algorithm to identify the electromechanical mode of low frequency oscillation in interconnected power systems, and then chaos particle swarm algorithm combined with the cloud model of adaptive adjustment of inertia weight coefficient is adopted to coordinate and optimize the parameters of each DC modulation controller. In this method, multi-signal is firstly introduced into traditional Prony algorithm to combinationally identify low frequency oscillations in AC/DC hybrid systems, and then the mutual influence between the DC modulators are identified and simplified, which is used as the basis of the coordination and optimization model. On the basis of it, we use the chaos cloud particle swarm optimization algorithm with high precision and rapid convergence to optimize the parameters of each DC modulation controller. Through simulation in eight-generator three-region multi-infeed AC/DC power transmission system, and the results show that DC modulation controllers based on improved Prony with its parameters optimized by chaos cloud particle swarm algorithm attached to system can maximize regional power oscillation damping, and enhance the system operation stability, and possess quite good control effects. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Twelve possible combinations of three WF level reactive power dispatch strategies and fourWind Turbine (WT) level reactive power control strategies are investigated. All of the combined strategies are formulated based on the comprehensive loss models of WFs, including the loss models of DFIGs, converters, filters, transformers, and cables of the collection system. Optimization problems are solved by a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated by simulations on a carefully designed WF under a series of cases with different wind speeds and reactive power requirements of the WF. The wind speed at each WT inside the WF is calculated using the Jensen wake model. The results show that the best reactive power dispatch strategy for loss minimization comes when the WF level strategy and WT level control are coordinated and the losses from each device in the WF are considered in the objective. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Coordinated or cooperative control of wind farms can increase power output reducing cost of energy (COE) per area. The increase in production depends upon wind conditions, terrain characteristics and wind farm layout. This work develops an assessment methodology for identifying potential wind conditions where coordinated control can increase farm power output. Average normalised power across all directions, average relative power with reference to a specified turbine and average relative efficiency with respect to the turbine producing maximum power were used for identifying the negative impact of wakes on power output. A dynamic farm controller is presented that exploits the benefits of reducing power of the upstream turbine(s) for increasing overall farm production. The dynamic controller uses a modified version of the Jensen model for wind speed deficit calculation. This model calculates the wake decay coefficient on a turbine by turbine basis. The decay coefficient varies according to turbulence intensity inside the farm. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is used for selecting an optimum set of turbine coefficients of power (Cp). The assessment methodology and farm controller were applied to data from two operating onshore wind farms to determine the benefits of coordinated control. The dynamic farm controller can increase power production up to 10% when compared to the conventional greedy control. The modified Jensen model accurately predicted the wind speed deficit in most of the cases. The case study farms were optimised in under 5 seconds on a simple computer. This makes the dynamic controller very suitable for online real time operations.},

The system, called the Autonomous Entity Operations Network Flight Control System (AEON-FCS), is being developed to be capable of implementing both classic Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) law algorithms in a monolithic system architecture and also a network connected fully distributed control system. AEON-FCS is a subset of the overall AEON system that includes the Avionics System for Remotely Operated Vehicles LiTe (ASROV-LT) codebase and additional data centric tools for distributed control implementation and rapid simulation and testing. The ASROV-LT codebase provides utilities for hard real-time light control loop processing and serialized sensor parsing. To enable rapid testing of autonomous algorithms, AEON-FCS provides seamless integration between simulation and hardware by utilizing a data centric inter-process communication approach and a global data bus available on the network. A goal for the AEON-FCS is to enable implementation of fully distributed control. Processing locations may be paired with sensors and distributed across either an airframe or across different air and/or ground vehicles on the network connected system. AEON-FCS aims to enable agile, high performance, robust operation of single or multiple cooperative UAV performing challenging missions like search and rescue under the forest canopy, delivery in rapidly changing unstructured environments (rescue in burning building), and ensemble collaboration for robust resilient system operations in hostile environments.

Cooperative behaviour in decentralized mobile agents requires communication among them. However, such communication can have negative consequences for the energy consumption. In this paper, we applied two bio-inspired meta-heuristics for the coordination of mobile robots that need to accomplish some tasks in an unknown area under a energy constraint. We address the issue on how the swarm communicates which the others to resolve some targets disseminated in the area cooperatively in a situation when there is a sudden stop of one or more robots for the battery consumption. The proposed strategies implement different communication approaches. The first employs the sensing communication between the swarm using a pheromone like a recruiting mechanism and the other strategy employs a wireless communication among the swarm. A simulator, that implements the strategies, was developed and the experimental set ups evaluate the quality of the two meta-heuristics considering how good solution is in terms of energy consumption taking into account the number of resolved targets and percentage of explored cells. We compares these two methods with the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

	abstract = {The need for multi-functional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations (e.g., in disaster response), or for adapting to varying conditions, have given rise to hybrid UAVs. Of particular interest are hybrid platforms that provide some combination of VTOL, hovering, and long-range flight capabilities, by operating in and transitioning between distinct flight states. This paper proposes a new hybrid UAV that seeks to address the drawbacks (e.g., rotor under-usage and cross-wind vulnerability) of existing designs (tilt-rotor/tilt-body/tilt-wing), and thereby provide increased operational flexibility. This UAV, called the BWB-Integrated Transitioning UAV or BITU, comprises a pair of tilt-arms (with two rotors mounted on the ends) that can rotate about shafts; the latter are integrated into the wing tips of the blended wing body (BWB). A conceptual design framework is developed to explore the feasibility/performance of BITU, which includes numerical mass and inertia estimation, aerodynamic analysis, and simulation and control of the state transition dynamics. Two design case studies are performed using mixed-discrete PSO. The optimal designs of BITU are found to provide competitive combinations of weight (< 5.5kg), payload capacity (2kg specified), hovering endurance (20min @ 40km roundtrip range), and forward flight range (> 270 km), and substantial improvement over the baseline. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {Over 40% of the United States population visit the beach each year. For the 10 year period between 2003 and 2012, lifeguards made on average 67,700 rescues per year. Rip currents account for 80% of annual beach rescues and fatalities. When a lifeguard spots the victim, the lifeguards must reach the victim before a mean time of 102 seconds (σ = 30s). This paper presents the design of the Life-ring Delivery Drone System, which delivers life-rings to victims faster than a lifeguard. Once victims have a life-ring, they can survive long enough until the lifeguard reaches them. A stochastic simulation of rip-current victim's location and time-to-drown was used to determine the optimal drone launch location of near a lifeguard tower, and operational range covering one lifeguard section while using a flight path avoiding overhead flight of beach goers. An Analytical Hierarchy Process determined that a tethered life ring is the best flotation device for this application. The drone size-weight-power design space was analyzed with a system dynamics model to determine that an octocopter with a 1000 mm wheelbase, 10.2 kg total weight, using a battery with 20000 mAh energy capacity provided the optimal size, power, and endurance. The Life-ring Delivery Drone System results in a reduction in mean time to reach a victim of 39% (reducing standard deviation by 66%), increasing the probability of a successful rescue from 92.3% to 99.4%. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today's giant data centers are power hungry. Data center energy saving not only helps control the operational cost, but also benefits the sustainable growth of cloud services. Due to the adoption of much more switches in modern data centers as well as the mature server-side power management techniques, energy saving for the data center network is becoming increasingly important. Most previous works on saving data center network energy focus on aggregating flows to as few switches as possible. However, in this paper we argue that this method may not work for network-limited flows, the throughputs of which are elastic based on the competing flows. To save the network energy consumed by this kind of elastic flows, we propose a flow scheduling approach called Willow, which takes both the number of switches involved and their active working durations into consideration. We formulate this problem by programming and design a greedy approximate algorithm to schedule flows in an online manner. Simulations based on MapReduce traces show that Willow can save up to 60 percent network energy compared with ECMP scheduling in typical settings, and outperforms other classical heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Testbed Experiments demonstrate that this kind of dynamic energy-efficient flow scheduling causes negligible impact on upper-layer applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Route planning is an important step for the automatic unmanned aerial vehicles, and the quality of route planning will directly affect the energy consumption and pesticide consumption of unmanned aerial vehicles. Currently plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles rely too much on artificial remote, the flight routes are not planned precisely and the actual flight routes are often seriously different from the theoretical routes, especially in the irregular areas. So research on route planning method suitable for automatic unmanned aerial vehicles is necessary. Aimed to the operation area with irregular convex polygon shape, a kind of operation route planning algorithm is proposed to extract the unmanned aerial vehicles' operation routes in any specified operating direction quickly. Latitude and longitude coordinates of border points are converted to the metric ones, environment coordinate is built to convert operation area borders to coordinate volume, and coordinate transformation is according to the operation direction, which makes it easier to compute. The operation area is divided into a plurality of sub-regions, and each sub-region's start and stop operation waypoint are set by considering the flight distance and pesticide consumption; all operation waypoints are connected to get operation routes, which can minimize the excess coverage area and the waste of pesticides. When the operation direction is not specified, the route planning algorithm can also give a recommended operation direction and route to make energy and pesticide consumption minimal in the entire operation process. The simulation results showed that using this algorithm in an irregular convex pentagon area of 983.125 m2, when the course angle of the operation routes was set to be 0̊, 45̊, 90̊ and 135̊, corresponding total flight distance was 273.38, 291.30, 273.68 and 293.78 m, coverage area was 1 121.8, 1 195.5, 1 169.2 and 1 197 m, excess coverage rate was 14.1%, 21.6%, 18.9% and 21.8%, respectively. The total flight distance and coverage area with course angle of 0̊ were the least among 4 kinds of course angles, and its energy and pesticide consumption were also the least. While the best operating course angle of the convex pentagon area was 100̊, and its corresponding coverage area and excess coverage rate were 1 096.5 m2 and 11.5%. In field tests, the minimum excess coverage rate was 2.8%, which showed the feasibility of the operation route planning algorithm; while the test results also showed the deviations between theoretical and practical operation routes, and the possible reasons were GPS positioning error, wind and unstable center of gravity due to liquid, so the GPS positioning accuracy needed to be improved, and flight control systems also needed further improvement to make the flight attitude of unmanned aerial vehicle more stable. Operation routes are planned by the route planning algorithm before operation, and energy and pesticide consumption can be previously estimated, which can save the time consumed by preparation work and make unmanned aerial vehicle operation more efficient. Nowadays, unmanned plant protection operation by unmanned aerial vehicle becomes popular, and planning and management of the operation also become very important, and hence this flight route planning algorithm not only saves manpower required by route planning, but also makes operation management easier. In addition, the algorithm also reduces the deposition of pesticides in non-operating areas and is conducive to environment protection. The algorithm is suitable for automatic unmanned aerial vehicles and can be widely used in the area of precision agriculture. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) receive a growing interest for agricultural purposes. The aim is to provide inspiring insights in this domain from a technological and computational point of view. In these last years, indeed, there is an enormous potential that UAV technologies presents to support the agricultural domain in monitoring the land for checking and countering the presence of parasites that can damage the crop. However, to properly manage a UAVs team, equipped with multiple sensors and actuators, it is necessary to test these technologies and design proper strategies and coordination techniques able to efficiently manage the team. At this purpose, the paper proposes a simulator suitable for the agriculture domain in order to design novel coordination and control techniques of a UAVs team. Moreover it is possible to define the main variables and parameters of this domain of interest. The work presented many coordination techniques both for monitoring the area and both for coordinating the actions of the drones in the presence of parasites in order to analyze how the performance can significantly change if more constraints, such as energy, communication range, resource capacities, are accounted. © 2017 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

	abstract = {This paper develops a vision-based tracking system in unmanned aerial vehicles based on thermal images. The tracking system are tailored toward objects at sea and consists of three main modules that are independent. The first module is an object detection algorithm that uses image analysis techniques to detect marine vessels in thermal images and extract the center of each object. Moreover, as long as the size of the vessel is known or computed in an image where the whole vessel is visible, the center can be identified in situations where only a part of the object is visible. The pixel position of the center is used in a nonlinear state estimator to estimate the position and velocity in a world-fixed coordinate frame. This is called the filtering part of the tracking system. The state estimator is nonlinear because only two coordinates in the world-frame can be computed with the pixel coordinates. This originates from the fact that cameras are bearing-only sensors that are unable to measure range. The last module in the tracking system is data association, which is used to relate new measurements with existing tracks. The tracking system is evaluated in two different case studies. The first case study investigates three different measures for data association in a Monte Carlo simulation. The second case study concerns tracking of a single object in a field experiment, where the object detection algorithm and the filtering part of the tracking system are evaluated. The results show that the modules in the tracking system are reliable with high precision. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

In order to improve the voltage stability and operating economy of regional power grid connected with medium or large-scale wind farms, this paper presents a reactive power coordination optimization model to satisfy reactive power management of a wind farm group. To solve this multi-objective optimization problem, multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm was adopted for fast reactive power regulating of the wind farm group. Simulation results on case study demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm for reactive power coordination control considering voltage stability and economic operating. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have crucial roles to play in traditional warfare, asymmetric conflicts, and also civilian applications such as search and rescue operations. Though satellites provide extensive coverage and capabilities crucial to many remote sensing tasks, UAVs have distinct edge over satellites in dynamic situations due to shorter revisit times and desired area/time coverage. The course, speed and altitude of a UAV can be dynamically altered, details of an activity of interest monitored by loitering over the area as desired. A fundamental requirement in most UAV operations is to find geo-coordinates of an object in the captured image. Most small, low-cost UAVs use low-cost, less accurate sensors. Matching with pre-registered images may not be possible in areas with low details or in emergency situations where terrain may have undergone severe sudden changes. In these situations that demand near real-time results and wider coverage, it is often enough to provide approximate results as long as bounds on accuracies can be established. Even when image registration is possible, it can benefit from these bounds to reduce search space thereby saving execution time. The prime contributions of this paper are computation of location of target anywhere in the image even at larger slant ranges, optimized algorithm to compute terrain elevation at target point, and use of visual simulation tool to validate the model. Analysis from simulation and results from real UAV flights are presented. Copyright © 2014, IGI Global.},

Installation capacity and power of battery storage has great influence on effect of decreasing forecast error and economy. This paper builds probability distribution model of wind farm forecast error based on T location-scale (TLS) distribution and simulates forecast error persistence with geometric distribution. Then model parameters are obtained with maximum likehood estimation in particle swarm optimization. Wind farm profit maximization is taken as optimization objective and confidence of decreasing forecast error as chance constraint in the optimization model. Correction of wind farm forecast output is included in the model. Results show that the proposed method fits probability density function and duration of wind farm forecast error correctly. Total profit of wind farm and battery storage is better than that not considering forecast error duration and forecast output correction.

	abstract = {This paper presents the various stages of integrating both the hardware and software of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Quadrotor at University of Glasgow Singapore (UGS). Research and development process is done to enable the Quadrotor to fly autonomously by itself through a designated flight path plan and also as swarm formation through coordinated flight path plan with other Quadrotors. Various maneuvers of Quadrotors can also be presented in the coordinated flight path plan. This research consists of four phases. The first stage is dealing with the understanding of the fundamentals of Quadrotor and deriving the equations of motion that are required by the Quadrotor. With this knowledge, we can better deal with our Quadrotor and ensure it is functionality to meet our desired objectives. PID controllers can be added in the simulation to enhance the stability. Concurrently, we built up our Quadrotor with the components that were required and did regular checks to ensure that our Quadrotor was functional, and no safety hazards were being compromised. The second phase be doing the simulation of our equations of motion in SIMULINK and troubleshooting to fine-tune any problems that arose with our mathematical models by monitoring the simulation results closely. Close supervision is needed with our simulation as we aim to be as precise as possible to integrate better into the hardware part of the Quadrotor. The third phase be integrating the software and hardware of our Quadrotor together. Hardware test was done using OptiTrack Software, which monitored the flight movement of our Quadrotor and output experimental results. These results enable us to plot the performance of our Quadrotor in MATLAB as seen in the paper. We also did some testing with both hovering and translational movement, followed by an integration of autonomous control into our Quadrotor. Based on the inbuilt GPS device in our Quadrotor, It flew strictly based on the designated flight path plan in the air space autonomously using mission planner. Experimental results were also presented and plotted up in MATLAB as seen in the later part of the paper. The last phase will be a simulation of swarm formation with many Quadrotors through coordinated flight path plan using SIMULINK and MATLAB. After an intense research into available sources, leader-follower method was adopted. In total, we did three simulated maneuvers. This allows it to fly with other Quadrotors both simultaneously and autonomously. © 2015 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {In multi-target tracking scenarios of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the high computational complexity becomes a serious problem for the cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter (CPHD) because of the dense targets and intensive clutter. This paper proposes a novel multi-target tracking algorithm termed decoupled unbiased converted measurements adaptive gating cardinalized probability hypothesis density (DUCM-AG-CPHD) algorithm to solve this problem. Firstly, the proposed algorithm utilizes the decoupled unbiased converted method to obtain more information about the polar coordinate measurements. Meanwhile, it compensates for the converted error caused by coordinate transformation. Secondly, a novel adaptive gating strategy is designed to eliminate uncorrelated measurements, which can reduce the computational complexity. Finally, the Gaussian mixture implementation of the proposed algorithm is adopted to achieve efficient performance. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm yields a considerable reduction in computational complexity and improves the estimated precision of both the number of targets and the states. © 2017, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

The primary goal of realizing this methodology is to realize both multi-view imaging of visible damage and multi-mode sensing of intrinsic condition changes, which reasonably should serve better the first responders to make rational decisions regarding structural integrity assessment. Other technology novelties include the use of micro or small unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. drones) for conducting and coordinating aerial imaging and ground sensing through robotic sensor deployment and path management.

Their emergent behaviour allows crowds to have patterns which are not externally planned. Researchers prove that a crowd in emergency situations has a well-determined emergent behaviour. The pedestrian crowd simulation systems in case of emergency must have these emergent behaviours in order to prove its effectiveness. For this purpose we have created the E-PHuNAC model (Evacuation-Personalities' Human's Nature of Autonomous Crowds). Our model takes into account the three main perspectives for understanding the behaviour of crowds in an evacuation. Indeed, we have considered the normative affiliation, social identity and panic. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the E-PHuNAC model and also prove that the swarm behaviour of pedestrians' agents in this model allows the emergence of these global patterns.

The planning is managed for two master and slave levels. At slave level, all generation company (GENCO) and transmission company (TRANSCO) maximize their profit and then at master level, the system constraints are checked by independent system operator (ISO). In other words, the proposed planning aims at maximizing the expected profit of all GENCOs and TRANSCOs, while considering security and reliability constraints such as reserve margin and loss of load expectation (LOLE). The proposed problem is a constrained, nonlinear, mixed-integer optimization programming and solved by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method.

In this paper, we present a conceptual model of how such an architecture can be organized and we specify the features that an IoD system based on our architecture should implement. For doing so, we extract key concepts from three existing large scale networks, namely the air traffic control network, the cellular network, and the Internet, and explore their connections to our novel architecture for drone traffic management. A simulation platform for IoD is being implemented, which can be accessed from www.IoDnet.org in the future. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Autonomous navigation is a crucial technology in the field of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), intelligent robots and smartcars. To overcome shortages in traditional visual navigation methods, a landmark fixed high-precision binocular visual autonomous navigation method, based on the camera egomotion estimation theory, was put forward. In this method, camera's egomotion parameters, velocity and angular velocity, were measured from the variance between frames of the continuing image sequence, then the position and attitude was calculated by accumulating the velocity and angular velocity. Moreover, by bringing in the absolute positioning information provided by the landmarks, the performance of the method in long time navigation was improved. Combining the absolute positioning information from the landmarks and the relative navigation information from the binocular vision, as well as modeling and decoupling the measurement noise of the binocular vision, the accumulation and increasing of the navigation error was suppressed. Simulation result shows that this method has the advantage of high precision, autonomy and completeness of navigation information.},

	abstract = {A new generation of UAVs is coming that will help improve the situational awareness and assessment necessary to ensure quality data collection, especially in difficult conditions like natural disasters. Operators should be relieved from time-consuming data collection tasks as much as possible and at the same time, UAVs should assist data collection operations through a more insightful and automated guidance thanks to advanced sensing capabilities. In order to achieve this vision, two challenges must be addressed though. The first one is to achieve a sufficient autonomy, both in terms of navigation and of interpretation of the data sensed. The second one relates to the reliability of the UAV with respect to accidental (safety) or even malicious (security) risks. This however requires the design and development of new embedded architectures for drones to be more autonomous, while mitigating the harm they may potentially cause. We claim that the increased complexity and flexibility of such platforms requires resorting to modelling, simulation, or formal verification techniques in order to validate such critical aspects of the platform. This paper first discusses the potential and challenges faced by autonomous UAVs for data acquisition. The design of a flexible and adaptable embedded UAV architecture is then addressed. Finally, the need for validating the properties of the platform is discussed. Our approach is sketched and illustrated with the example of a lightweight drone performing 3D reconstructions out of the combination of 2D image acquisition and a specific motion control.},

This paper is focused on decision-making algorithm for the failure detection applied to Angle-of-Arrival (A-o-A) integrity monitoring method in a case when the fixed decision threshold is preset in accordance with false alarm probability restricted for all possible observing satellite constellations. Decision threshold value was obtained for a different number of satellites by statistical simulations for quite a number of randomly generated satellite constellations with suitable geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) level. Minimum number of navigation signals was estimated for the situation when the simplest three elements antenna array implemented on compact UAV is used for a direction-finding procedure. As a result A-o-A integrity monitoring efficiency was estimated for real GPS satellite constellation under conditions when decision threshold was fixed as insensitive to satellite constellation geometry. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

	abstract = {In the seminal research into simulated swarming, Reynolds developed a methodology that guided a flock of agents using just three rules: collision avoidance, swarm centering, and velocity matching. By modifying these rules, an algorithm is created and applied to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) so each aircraft in a "swarm" maintains a precise position relative to the preceding aircraft. Each aircraft experiences a decrease in induced aerodynamic drag, thus reducing overall fuel consumption, increasing range and endurance and expanding UAS utility. A simulation demonstrates the feasibility of the drag reduction swarm using a drag benefit map constructed from extant research. Due to both agent interaction and wind gust variability, the optimal position for drag reduction presented a severe collision hazard, and drag reduction was much more sensitive to lateral (wingtip) position than longitudinal (stream-wise) position. By increasing longitudinal spacing, the collision hazard was acceptably reduced. For one scenario, compared to a single UAS, a swarm of 10 aircraft demonstrated a 9.7% reduction in total aerodynamic drag, decreased fuel consumption by 14.2% and an increased endurance by 14.5%. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, the UAS has been extensively exploited for data collection from remote and dangerous or inaccessible areas. While most of its existing applications have been directed toward surveillance and monitoring tasks, the UAS can play a significant role as a communication network facilitator. For example, the UAS may effectively extend communication capability to disaster-affected people (who have lost cellular and Internet communication infrastructures on the ground) by quickly constructing a communication relay system among a number of UAVs. However, the distance between the centers of trajectories of two neighboring UAVs, referred to as IUD, plays an important role in the communication delay and throughput. For instance, the communication delay increases rapidly while the throughput is degraded when the IUD increases. In order to address this issue, in this article, we propose a simple but effective dynamic trajectory control algorithm for UAVs. Our proposed algorithm considers that UAVs with queue occupancy above a threshold are experiencing congestion resulting in communication delay. To alleviate the congestion at UAVs, our proposal adjusts their center coordinates and also, if needed, the radius of their trajectory. The performance of our proposal is evaluated through computer-based simulations. In addition, we conduct several field experiments in order to verify the effectiveness of UAV-aided networks. © 2016 IEEE.},

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid intelligent WT+NNPSO model, which takes into account the interactions of wind power, wind speed, wind direction, and temperature in the forecast process, the real data of wind farms located in the southern Alberta, Canada, are used to train and test the proposed model.

	abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) has become a common basic component in agricultural information collection and monitoring technology. However, with the rapidly increasing agriculture monitoring requirement, the limitations of traditional static wireless sensor network (SWSN) have emerged, including the heterogeneous network power consumption, the weak performance of network and the lack of node's computing. In order to solve the SWSN's unbalanced energy consumption problem and improve the node's transmission capacity, an agricultural crop image monitoring system based on mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) technology is proposed in this paper, which contains end-device nodes (ENs), coordinator node (CN) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system architecture is divided into 3 layers: the information collection layer (ENs and cameras), the information relay layer (CN and UAV) and the information concentration layer. In the information collection layer, the ENs combined with cameras are used to detect, and convert JPEG picture into coding message. The gateway consists of CN and 3G module in the information relay layer. It takes the message from EN while UAV flies over EN. All messages are stored into the information concentration layer. This layer is also called management center, which can decode messages and show plant images. It is important to note that the device used in MWSN does not include route nodes (RNs). Instead of using multi-hop scheme by RNs to transmit image message, a single-hop mode is used in this paper, and all data can only be issued from ENs and entry into CN. SWSN's energy consumption is reduced by this way. On the other hand, the MWSN can ensure the data transmission performance and anti-interference ability and improve the network reliability effectively. We test the system from 2 aspects, the performance test of network via energy consumption modeling with MATLAB simulation and the network transfer capability test. Firstly, we test JN5139 power consumption under different conditions, and then create a model using "first order radio". The simulation shows that the energy consumption of the RNs is twice as much as EN (133 mW); in contrast, node consumption in MWSN is 133 mW (work mode) and 10 μW (sleep mode). Secondly, we test the performance of 2 kinds of networks. We put one EN on the ground, and test the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and package error rate (PER) of CN in different spatial locations. The results show that for the RSSI within the 35 m, the MWSN's range is from -68 to -86 dbm and the SWSN's range is from -83 to -85 dbm, for the RSSI over 35 m, the MWSN's range is from -86 to -88 dbm and the SWSN's range is from -85 to -92 dbm, and for the PER between 10 and 80 m, the MWSN is from 0 to 9.2% and the SWSN is from 0 to 38.6%. The results show universal phenomenon of unbalanced energy consumption of SWSN. But the MWSN not only balances energy consumption, but also has low energy consumption level. These results indicate that the performance of MWSN is better than SWSN within a certain range. A set of experiments are carried out in the small potato plantations in the campus of Qiqihar University in July 2015. Three lower power JN5139 modules (ENs) are arranged at a distance of 100 m. It should be noted that, ENs can't transmit data interactively, and only send data to CN. Thus, the four-rotor UAV flies into the area at a slow speed, and hovers 15 m high from the ground to receive the message. At any moment, only one EN can communicate with the CN. The experiment shows that, the average time which is cost in acquisition and transmission of JPEG picture is about 135 s, and the number of package sent is 22 on average. The decoded images can reflect the growth status of plants well. In conclusion, the results of experiment show that the method is effective and applicable. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {The coordination of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to carry out aerial surveys is a major challenge for emergency responders. In particular, UAVs have to fly over kilometre-scale areas while trying to discover casualties as quickly as possible. To aid in this process, it is desirable to exploit the increasing availability of data about a disaster from sources such as crowd reports, satellite remote sensing, or manned reconnaissance. In particular, such information can be a valuable resource to drive the planning of UAV flight paths over a space in order to discover people who are in danger. However challenges of computational tractability remain when planning over the very large action spaces that result. To overcome these, we introduce the survivor discovery problem and present as our solution, the first example of a continuous factored coordinated Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Our evaluation against state of the art benchmarks show that our algorithm, Co-CMCTS, is able to localise more casualties faster than standard approaches by 7% or more on simulations with real-world data. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes novel multiple access schemes for a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In a super dense aerial sensor network, small UAVs communicate and transmit data from one to another, and thus leading to unavoidable packet collisions among actors. In light of that, this work introduces a novel proposal of multiple access scheme based on a hybrid collision coordination technique, a combination of CSMA/CA and TDMA protocols. The newly proposed MAC protocol is named as CC-MAC in this paper. Besides, a system model considered in this paper focuses on a swarm of UAVs in a super dense network environment. These UAVs are used to sense and collect a real-time data from a disaster area. The information is then transmitted from joint UAV nodes to a more powerful node called a master UAV. Moreover, this paper also adopts a spatial diversity technique and introduces a simultaneous data transmission scheme based on a partnership of two nearby UAVs. Thus, nodes in a network allocation vector state (NAV) of CC-MAC can simultaneously transmit their packets without any delay or collision. Simulation results show that both proposed MAC protocols offer a huge performance improvement in average throughput and delay compared to an IEEE 802.11 CSMA/CA. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Guaranteeing network connectivity in post-disaster scenarios is challenging yet crucial to save human lives and to coordinate the operations of first responders. In this paper, we investigate the utilization of low-altitude aerial mesh networks composed by Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs) in order to re-enstablish connectivity among isolated end-user (EU) devices located on the ground. Aerial ad-hoc networks provide the advantage to be deployable also on critical scenarios where terrestrial mobile devices might not operate, however their implementation is challenging from the point of view of mobility management and of coverage lifetime. In this paper, we address both these issues with three novel research contributions. First, we propose a distributed mobility algorithm, based on the virtual spring model, through which the SUAV-based mesh node-called also Repairing Units (RUs) in this study- can self-organize into a mesh structure by guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) over the aerial link, and connecting the maximum number of EU devices. Second, we evaluate our scheme on a realistic 3D environment with buildings, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the aerial deployment compared to a terrestrial one, in terms of coverage and wireless link reliability. Third, we address the problem of energy lifetime, and we propose a distributed charging scheduling scheme, through which a persistent coverage of RUs can be guaranteed over the emergency scenario. © 2014 IEEE.},

One key aspect of the MARS concept is the low individual intelligence, meaning that each robot is equipped with only a minimum of sensor technology in order to achieve a low cost and energy efficient system that provides scalability and reliability for field tasks. The robot swarms are coordinated by a centralized entity (OptiVisor) which is responsible for path planning, optimization and supervision. It also serves as a mediator between the robots and different cloud services responsible for the documentation of the procedure. This paper focuses on the architecture and function of OptiVisor within the overall MARS system. An OptiVisor in combination with a simulation environment for a robot swarm is presented and shows the feasibility of the general concept and the current state of the algorithms. Furthermore, the paper shows results about the current progress of OptiVisor integration using real robots. © 2016 IEEE.},

First of all, taking KPCA as the front-end system to extract the main components of the localization information, and then regarding the nonlinear principal components extracted from distance vectors as the input samples, and meanwhile taking the coordinates of vertices in addition to the region boundary as the output samples, the PSO-BP neural network is trained to achieve the localization model.

Unmanned system is one of the solution that replace people in the rescue operation. However, there are still some obvious defects of unmanned system that are difficult to overcome, such as the limited perspective of the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and the short flight endurance of a micro multi-rotor craft also called little Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). At the same time, they both have other advantages that the other one does not have, for instance, the long cruising ability of the USV and the broad horizons of the UAV.

Firstly, the impact of WEF on the relays coordination is focused, after that we search for the new relays setting to ensure an optimal coordination of the relays. The coordination problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear mono-objective optimization problem. The objective function of this optimization problem is the minimization of the operation time of the associated relays. In terms of decision variables; two types of optimizations are considered in this paper, namely: real parameter optimization where, the time dial setting (TDS), and the pickup current setting (IP) are considered as the real decision variables of the optimization problem and the mixed integer optimization, where the IEC curve characteristic of each relay is added to the previous variables as an integer decision variable. The characteristics of the relays are always chosen arbitrary or by trial and error method. To solve this constrained non linear optimization problem, the particle swarm optimization method is used. The proposed method is validated on IEEE 8-bus power transmission test systems considering various scenarios.},

Firstly, an energy control method of HEMS was present to improve efficiency and flexibility of MG operation; Secondly, an optimization problem was formulated considering not only to reduce the total investment, operation maintenance cost, network loss caused by imported power from the transmission grid, and un-served load in case of emergency, but also to maximize the excess generated power by the HEMS that may be injected into the distribution network.; Finally, an improved artificial bee colony (ABC)based on particle swarm optimization(PSO) was put forward to increase convergence speed.

	abstract = {At present, the coal mine rescue robot is without the power supply in the hazard and complex coal mine and the explosive-proof batteries unit influences dynamic performance very seriously. It is the only method to solve the two problems above by power matching and optimization. Therefore, the power matching design method based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The optimization goal and constraint condition for power matching are confirmed by the analysis of the robot dynamic performance requirement. And the model of the robot power matching is established and the decision variables of multi-objective optimization are ensured, which are based on the tracked vehicle dynamic and the influence for the dynamic performance by explosive-proof batteries unit. Finally, it is calculated which the reasonable value range of the parameters of power matching. The test indicates that the mass of the coal mine rescue robot has reduced by 24.36% and the time of endurance is double.

	abstract = {The technology of weed recognition based on machine vision becomes the research focus of precision agriculture. In order to realize the precise weeding technology, it is required to recognize weeds and crops rapidly and precisely. In this research, the high accurate recognition method of weed was studied. Maize seedlings of 2 to 5 leaves stage and weed during same stage were used as research object and method of accurate recognition of weed based on SVM recognition model that fusion height feature and image features was studied. We found that maize seedlings were generally higher than the weeds during the same period. This fact could allow us to have a more accurate recognition evidence for the SVM recognition model. In this paper, we conducted accuracy analysis. Binocular vision system was built and calibrated, an image acquisition system was designed and binocular images of crops and weeds were grabbed. The calibration results of binocular camera were evaluated using re-projection error. The average re-projection error was 0.08 pixels, and no more than 0.1 pixels. This demonstrated that the binocular image acquisition system had a high accuracy of the calibration processing. We also pretreated the collected images with methods of Excess-green feature, Improved Otsu, Area filtering, Canny edge detection. Sixteen morphological features and two texture features in monocular image based on image pretreatment were obtained. Then we proposed the height feature extraction method of plant. Based on binocular images, the height feature of plant can be extracted by this method quickly. Firstly, with height feature extraction method, the binocular gray image was masked with binocular binary image. With this processing on binocular image, the background information irrelevant to the recognition target was removed and the processing speed of the algorithm was improved. Then the speed up robust feature algorithm was used to detect the feature points in the masked binocular gray image. The method had good robustness. Matching feature points were detected between left and right images by the sum of absolute differences method. Those matching feature points that were not suitable for constraint of epipolar line were removed. Projective transformation matrix was worked out using basic matrix and coordinate of matching feature points. Moreover, the binocular images were corrected based on projective transformation matrix. With these processing, the left image and right image were corrected to the same horizontal epipolar line, the bad effect of mechanical vibration on image quality was reduced, and the robustness of the method in this paper was significantly improved. Next, the accurate disparity map was obtained by combining global error energy minimization algorithm with the average error threshold filter. Matching block in the size of 5 × 5 was selected in this processing. In this condition, processing speed of the method was maximized, and calculation precision was satisfied. Finally, according to the geometrical principle of binocular vision, the depth information was calculated based on the disparity map. The maximum depth information of the target area was referred to the height feature of plant. The error between actual height and calculation was less than ±12mm. After that, we divided weeding period into three stages and built SVM recognition model with fusion height feature and image features for each stage. Based on the max-min ant system algorithm, we selected the optimal morphological features of each model. As a result, the morphological features were reduced from 16 to 6, feature data was reduced by 62.5%. By using three kinds of algorithms: genetic algorithm, k-fold cross validation, and particle swarm optimization, the two core parameters of each SVM recognition model were optimized, and the optimal parameters were selected by comparing effects of three algorithms. The optimal parameters c and g contained by this way can effectively improve the recognition ability of SVM model, and avoid the over-learning and under-learning state of SVM model. The test set was used to test the recognition rate of SVM model of each stage, and the contrast experiment of the SVM model that did not fusion height feature and image features was carried out. After all those processes the weed recognition system was established. It was necessary to segment the overlapping images of maize and weed. Watershed algorithm based on distance transform was used to solve this problem. Firstly, the segmentation line was determined by using watershed algorithm based on distance transformation. Then the overlapping image was segmented by morphology processing for maintain the original shape. Finally, the binary image after segmentation was adopted to mask the gray image and the segmentation of weeds and crops was realized. This method can effectively segment maize and weeds in the seedling stage. The results of this research showed that the recognition rate of the SVM model based on fusion height feature was 96.67%, 100%, 98.33%, with the average recognition rate of 98.33%. The recognition rate of the SVM model based on no fusion height feature was 93.33%, 91.67%, 95%, with the average recognition rate of 93.33%. The data showed that the SVM recognition model based on fusion height feature was better than the model without fusion height feature, and the average recognition rate was improved by 5%. Therefore, weed recognition method based on fusion height feature and SVM model can effectively improve the recognition rate and achieve high accuracy of weed recognition. The research results in this paper will provide reference for the development of precision weeding. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The constraints in hot mill processes are analyzed in three aspects—process schedule, product means, and energy consumption. According to actual experience, Hybrid Vehicle Routing Problem (HVRP) model is established to solve the scheduling problem which is a combination of variable fleet vehicle routing problem, prize collection vehicle routing, and capacitated vehicle routing problem. In this new algorithm, the PSO algorithm is redefined and modified by introducing metropolis criterion of SA twice, which is used to update two extremes of particle swarm, including the individual optimal solution and the global optimal solution to improve the convergence precision and the convergence rate.

Battery swapping station is a very important way of energy supply to EVs, and it is urgently needed to explore a coordinated control strategy to effectively smooth the load fluctuation in order to adopt the large-scale EVs. Considering bidirectional power flow between the station and power grid, this paper proposed a SFLA-based control strategy to smooth the load profile. Finally, compared simulations were performed according to the related data. Compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, the presented SFLA-based strategy can effectively lower the peak-valley difference with the faster convergence rate and higher convergence precision.

	abstract = {Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs) can enable a broad range of applications such as resource monitoring, disaster prevention, and navigation-assistance. Sensor nodes location in UWSNs is an especially relevant topic. Global Positioning System (GPS) information is not suitable for use in UWSNs because of the underwater propagation problems. Hence, some localization algorithms based on the precise time synchronization between sensor nodes that have been proposed for UWSNs are not feasible. In this paper, we propose a localization algorithm called Two-Phase Time Synchronization-Free Localization Algorithm (TP-TSFLA). TP-TSFLA contains two phases, namely, range-based estimation phase and range-free evaluation phase. In the first phase, we address a time synchronization-free localization scheme based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain the coordinates of the unknown sensor nodes. In the second phase, we propose a Circle-based Range-Free Localization Algorithm (CRFLA) to locate the unlocalized sensor nodes which cannot obtain the location information through the first phase. In the second phase, sensor nodes which are localized in the first phase act as the new anchor nodes to help realize localization. Hence, in this algorithm, we use a small number of mobile beacons to help obtain the location information without any other anchor nodes. Besides, to improve the precision of the range-free method, an extension of CRFLA achieved by designing a coordinate adjustment scheme is updated. The simulation results show that TP-TSFLA can achieve a relative high localization ratio without time synchronization. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Increasing deployment of intermittent power generation from renewable resources in the smart grid, such as photovoltaic (PV) or wind farm, will cause large system frequency fluctuation when the load-frequency control (LFC) capacity is not enough to compensate the unbalance of generation and load demand. Even worse, the system inertia will decrease when the smart grid is in island operating mode, which would degrade system damping and cause system instability. Meanwhile, electric vehicles (EVs) will be widely used by customers in the near future, where the EV station could be treated as dispersed battery energy storage. Therefore, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology can be employed to compensate for inadequate LFC capacity, thus improving the island smart grid frequency stability. In this paper, an on-line reinforcement learning (RL) based method, called goal representation adaptive dynamic programming (GrADP), is employed to adaptive control of units in an island smart grid. In the controller design, adaptive supplementary control signals are provided to proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller by GrADP in a real-time manner. Comparative simulation studies on a benchmark smart grid with micro-turbine (MT), EVs, PV array and wind power are carried out among the GrADP controller, the original PID controller and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) based fuzzy logic controller. Simulation results demonstrate competitive performance and satisfied learning ability of the GrADP based coordinate controller. Moreover, the impact of signal transmission delay on the control performance is also considered, and suggestions to address this issue are given in the paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Combined with the dynamic penalty function method, the wind turbine spacing constraints was realized; Based on this method, the optimal placement of wind turbines was performed. In the application process, the continuity and the constraint of the algorithm was improved. Through the algorithm, the reasonable number of wind turbine layout can be determined and the continuous placement of wind machine can be also realized, then, the total generating capacity of wind farm was improved effectively. On this basis, in order to explore the construction of the low wind speed area wind farm development and economic optimization, the response of wind turbine layout optimization scheme of electricity cost to wind change was studied. The results show that, when the fan is running at full capacity, with the wind speed increases, but the wind power costs will not be reduced on the application of particle swarm optimization algorithm.

	abstract = {Mobile robots are used in many applications, such as planetary exploration, search and rescue, surveillance. Cooperative behaviour in decentralized mobile agents requires communication among them. However, such communication can have negative consequences for the energy consumption. In this paper, we applied two bio-inspired meta-heuristics for the coordination of mobile robots that need to accomplish some tasks in an unknown area under a energy constraint. We address the issue on how the swarm communicates which the others to resolve some targets disseminated in the area cooperatively in a situation when there is a sudden stop of one or more robots for the battery consumption. The proposed strategies implement different communication approaches. The first employs the sensing communication between the swarm using a pheromone like a recruiting mechanism and the other strategy employs a wireless communication among the swarm. A simulator, that implements the strategies, was developed and the experimental set ups evaluate the quality of the two meta- heuristics considering how good solution is in terms of energy consumption taking into account the number of resolved targets and percentage of explored cells. We compares these two methods with the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Results indicates that the firefly-based strategy usually gives superior performance.},

	abstract = {With the anticipated explosion of small unmanned aerial vehicles, it is highly likely that operators will be controlling fleets of autonomous vehicles. To fulfill the promise of autonomy, vehicle operators will not be concerned with manual control of the vehicle; instead, they will deal with the overall mission. Furthermore, the one operator to many vehicles is becoming a constant meme with various industries including package delivery, search and rescue, and utility companies. In order for an operator to concurrently control several vehicles, his station must look and behave very differently than the current ground control station instantiations. Furthermore, the vehicle will have to be much more autonomous, especially during non-normal operations, in order to accommodate the knowledge deficit or the information overload of the operator in charge of several vehicles. The expected usage increase of small drones requires presenting the operational information generated by a fleet of heterogeneous autonomous agents to an operator. NASA Langley Research Center's Autonomy Incubator has brought together researchers in various disciplines including controls, trajectory planning, systems engineering, and human factors to develop an integrated system to study autonomy issues. The initial human factors effort is focusing on mission displays that would give an operator the overall status of all autonomous agents involved in the current mission. This paper will discuss the specifics of the mission displays for operators controlling several vehicles. © 2015},

The fuzzy constraints are converted to its equivalent deterministic form using different interval order relations. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm are used to obtain the optimal transportation schedule for the proposed solid transportation problem.

	abstract = {Multicopters drain much energy from the battery because of on-board avionics system and other devices. Limited by the battery capacity, missions that require longer flight time cannot be fulfilled if there is no vehicle replacement or external logistics support. Secondly, missions such as large area surveillance and reconnaissance require a fleet (swarm) of flying vehicles working in a collaborative and persistent way, which makes maintenance support more challenging. In view of this, we have designed an automatic multicopter refuelling system - an autonomous 'hot' battery swapping system which enables battery swapping for a quadcopter on the ground charging station so to minimize its down time. The system uses hot battery swapping to ensure no data loss during the swapping process. To achieve a fully autonomous flight mission, a precision landing design is also provided in this work. The design of the precise landing and autonomous refuelling will capacitate quadcopter (fleet) with flight endurance to support persistent mission requirements. This paper presents the automated battery swapping system for quadcopters which includes the design concept of the battery swapping mechanisms and the precise landing control with test results. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In order to acquire a more stable power unit, it is invaluable to find methods of enhancing plant stability. The position of Khoy combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is strategic from aspects of contribution in providing power for some important local and regional substations in proximity of Turkey. Current steam unit lacks any supplementary stabilizer and trips frequently following of various small and large perturbations. Hence, it seems to be essential to equip the unit with a good-structure industrial power system stabilizer (PSS) such as PSS2B to decrease risk of emergency outages. Nowadays in all over the world, new advanced industrial excitation control systems use IEEE Std. 421.5 to build practical stabilizer of PSS2B from the accelerating power signal to cover a wide range of oscillation frequencies. PSS2B module can be utilized as an add-on to retrofit excitation systems in refurbishment programs. The robust coordinated design of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) based PSS2B and PID-automatic voltage control (AVR) of the steam unit is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem in which adjustable parameters are optimized simultaneously via an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm by minimizing integral of time multiplied squared error (ITSE) performance index. Siemens RG3 excitation system is modeled according to IEEE AC7B. To evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of recommended stabilizer, eigenvalue analysis and dynamic simulations are performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK for different operating conditions and disturbances. The results show that proposed stabilizer can provide outstanding enhancement in dynamic stability for steam unit to reduce its emergency outages. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Locating trapped targets using the signals of wireless devices such as mobile phones carried by targets is increasingly becoming the preferred scheme for disaster rescue. However, the accuracy of radio-localization technology currently adopted in the rescue is not high enough. To solve such problems, researchers proposed the approaches of Warwalking or Wardriving. However, both approaches are all limited by application scenarios. This paper proposes GuideLoc, a highly efficient aerial wireless localization system, which uses the target guiding technology based on region division. GuideLoc allows an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly over a target device and provide position coordinates of the UAV as the target location information. During the process of positioning targets, based on the result of regional division, GuideLoc uses a number of fixed antennas to get the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and angle of arrival (AOA) information of the target and estimates the target location using the information and correspondingly controls the UAV to fly towards the target. Averaging method is also applied for determining coordinates of the target. Experiment results show that GuideLoc can in short time achieve 2.7-meter positioning accuracy in average. Compared with other wireless localization methods using UAVs proposed in the literature, it shortened the flight distance by more than 50%. In addition, energy efficiency is also improved significantly. Copyright © 2017 Anwen Wang et al.},

Incorporated with the probabilistic model of wind power output, the chance constraint including the random variable is converted to the deterministic constraint. Thereby, the multi-objective dispatch model with wind farms and flexible resources is established. Moreover, an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on crowding entropy(IMOPSO-CE) is put forward to solve the above model. Finally, taking a system composed of six thermal power units and one wind farm as an example, we compare and analyze the simulation results under different scheduling scenarios. It is demonstrated that the model proposed is reasonable and the IMOPSO-CE algorithm is effective, which can provide a new idea for solving dynamic economic environmental dispatch problem for power systems integrated with wind farms. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

	abstract = {There are two problems in unit commitment (UC) with wind power integration, high fitting precision of forecast error and appropriate selection of confidence interval. Aiming to solve the above problems, this paper proposed a new UC model with wind power integration. The first, based on the analysis of forecast error, a temporal segment method of forecast error was proposed, which used t location-scale distribution for fat tail effect, improving the fitting accuracy, and also coordinated with day-ahead UC in time series. The second, a new UC model with double quantiles was proposed, which considered traditional coasts, extra reserve costs and risk costs. In this model, the confidence interval determined by the constrains among different costs, the reserve style sorted by dividing different confidence interval, the time-varying confidence level used to correspond to temporal segment distribution, make the model more applicable and economic. The last, the improved hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm with heuristic searching strategy was proposed to solve the multivariate mixed integer programming problem, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2016 Chin.

	abstract = {Wide-area coordinating control is becoming an important issue and a challenging problem in the power industry. This paper proposes a novel optimal wide-area coordinating neurocontrol (WACNC), based on wide-area measurements, for a power system with power system stabilizers, a large wind farm and multiple flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. An optimal wide-area monitor (OWAM), which is a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), is designed to identify the input-output dynamics of the nonlinear power system. Its parameters are optimized through particle swarm optimization (PSO). Based on the OWAM, the WACNC is then designed by using the dual heuristic programming (DHP) method and RBFNNs, while considering the effect of signal transmission delays. The WACNC operates at a global level to coordinate the actions of local power system controllers. Each local controller communicates with the WACNC, receives remote control signals from the WACNC to enhance its dynamic performance and therefore helps improve system-wide dynamic and transient performance. The proposed control is verified by simulation studies on a multimachine power system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In order to solve the un-repetitive problem between design coordinate system and measurement coordinate system when a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) was used to inspect free form surfaces, Quasi Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) was proposed to realize the precise localization between measured surface and design surface. Then, according to the features of freeform surface form, the peak-valley error and root mean square error were used to evaluate the freeform surface forms together. The computation method of the objective function was described, in which QPSO is used to match the measured surface and the design surface and the detailed steps were established for solving parameter vectors by using QPSO. Finally, by calculating the surface profile errors of simulation example and many practical measured parts, the results verify that the proposed method can locate precisely freeform surfaces and the evaluation precision of freeform surface profile errors by the proposed method is higher 8%-15% than that by CMM software. The method is suitable for the form error evaluation of high precise freeform surface parts.},

	abstract = {The Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS) is a comprehensive prototype integrated coastal ocean observing system that was established in the summer of 2001. Its current configuration includes eleven solar-powered buoy-monitored locations with physical and optical sensors, four shore-based long-range HF radar systems for surface current measurement, operational circulation and wave models, satellite observations, inshore nutrient monitoring, and hourly web-delivery of data. It serves a broad array of real-time oceanographic and marine meteorological data and data products to scientists, state and federal regulators, the National Weather Service, both the US and Canadian Coast Guards, the National Data Buoy Center, educators, regional naturalresource managers, the Gulf of Maine fishing and maritime industries, local airports and airlines, sailors, and the general public. The ocean observing system that can be thought of as consisting of four major subsystems: the data acquisition subsystem; the data handling, processing, and archiving subsystem; the system of numerical nowcast and forecast models; and a web-based data distribution/presentation subsystem. The Gulf of Maine is a harsh operational environment. Winter storms pose severe challenges including the build up of sea ice on buoy, its solar panels, and its meteorological sensors. In summer the productive waters of the gulf can present severe biofouling problems that affect the operation of optical sensors. Thus, the periods of most difficult field operations coincide with the periods of greatest data value in terms of marine safety, search and rescue, and the monitoring biological productivity. Never-the-less, the data returns for the GoMOOS ocean sensor array has averaged approximately 90% over the first seven years of operation. This unusually high rate of data return is due in large part to our operational six-month duty/maintenance cycle on all equipment. We have 22 buoys for 11 locations, and 22 complete sets of instrumentation that are rotated in and out of service on a six month schedule. The challenges of the Gulf of Maine physical environment were largely understood a priori, and were incorporated into the system design criteria and the blueprints for the service and maintenance protocols. However, there were unanticipated challenges in the funding process that have caused the greatest difficulties, and which continue to pose a serious threat to continued operation and success of this ocean observing system, as well as others observing systems in the United States. Funding for the system has been chronically short and subject to the unpredictable fluctuations of a US congressional appropriations process. The inadequacy and variability of funding has substantially hampered the operations of many of the Integrated Ocean Observing Systems (IOOS), including GoMOOS, and has hindered technological improvements. The funding crisis has deepened to the point that, unless this trend is quickly reversed, the number of monitoring stations will be substantially reduced and system will no longer be able to serve many of citizens, organizations, and agencies that have come to rely upon the data it currently provides. Ocean sensors, ocean platform technologies, and modeling and visualization techniques are in a period of rapid technical development. If stable funding can be achieved, the capabilities of operational ocean observing systems could increase dramatically over the next decade. Autonomous vehicles could become the fast response survey fleet of the IOOS, as well as taking on routine, sustained marine survey functions that are already prohibitively expensive to perform using ships, and will become even more costly as energy costs rise in the future. Practical autonomous vehicles will likely expand beyond gliders and AUVs to include surface sail vessels and energy-efficient autonomous aerial drones. The combination of time series measurements from profiling packages on buoy arrays with the repeatedly spatial surveys of the autonomous fleets will provide a new look at our coastal oceans that could transform coastal ocean science and management. Coupled with these new platform advances will be significant growth in the areas of real-time biochemical sensors, sensor miniaturization, high-speed data telemetry technologies, increases in onboard data processing capabilities, routine two-way communications with submerged sensors, and advances in data visualization techniques that will amount to virtual presence. The single greatest enabling factor of these broad improvements to ocean observing operations and science appears, at present, to be the establishment of an adequate, stable, and predictable funding process. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Although significant progress has been made in precision machining of free-form surfaces recently, inspection of such surfaces remains a difficult problem. In order to solve the problem that no specific standards for the verification of free-form surface profile are available, the profile parameters of free-form surface are proposed by referring to ISO standards regarding form tolerances and considering its complexity and non-rotational symmetry. Non-uniform rational basis spline(NURBS) for describing free-form surface is formulated. Crucial issues in surface inspection and profile error verification are localization between the design coordinate system(DCS) and measurement coordinate system(MCS) for searching the closest points on the design model corresponding to measured points. A quasi particle swarm optimization(QPSO) is proposed to search the transformation parameters to implement localization between DCS and MCS. Surface subdivide method which does the searching in a recursively reduced range of the parameters u and ν of the NURBS design model is developed to find the closest points. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the design model is generated by NURBS and the measurement data of simulation example are generated by transforming the design model to arbitrary position and orientation, and the parts are machined based on the design model and are measured on CMM. The profile errors of simulation example and actual parts are calculated by the proposed method. The results verify that the evaluation precision of freeform surface profile error by the proposed method is higher 10%-22% than that by CMM software. The proposed method deals with the hard problem that it has a lower precision in profile error evaluation of free-form surface. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

It takes the sum of distance in the world coordinate between ground truth 3D points and calculated 3D points as cost function which is optimized by evolution algorithm (EA). The 3D points' coordinate are calculated by the imitated direct linear transformation (DLT) triangulation based on distortion compensation. This strategy can allow the two cameras' all parameters being optimized at the same time. Parameters optimization algorithms with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are introduced. Simulation and experiment are made under the same calibration data sets. A comparison for GA, PSO and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithms are made. The results show that the strategy of taking the 3D reconstruction errors as object function is feasible, the evolution algorithms have much higher calibration precision than that of the LM algorithm. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To improve the performance of maneuvering target tracking, a based on Swarm intelligent unscented particle filtering was proposed. In the new filter, application of the un-scented Kalman filter is used to generate the proposal distribution. Moreover, by introducing the thought of artificial fish school algorithm into particle filtering, the particle distribution and filtering accuracy can be improved. In simulation experiment, "Coordinated Turns" model is taken as dynamic model of maneuvering target. The simulation results show that unscented particle filtering optimized by the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA-UPF) has quite higher tracking precision than the PF and UPF by analyzing the tracking performance and the root-mean-square error. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Besides, the analog guidance law can not also apply digital signals come from the data link directly. Having the properties of anti-interference, variable structure control can be used to solve the measured error of the coordinate and the maneuvering of targets. But the traditional discrete variable structure algorithm has the defect of buffeting when getting into the sliding mode, which is harmful to the motor. In order to further improve the guided precision, a buffetless discrete variable structure guidance law based on disturbance compensation is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed discrete signal guidance law can meet the tactical requirements for UAV.},

With the proposed coordination control of VSCs in the WT-PMSGs and VSCHVDC system, the dynamic stability of the whole offshore wind energy system can be maintained under large disturbances. Then the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method is proposed for tuning controller parameters of VSCs to improve the dynamic performances of the whole energy system. Finally, case studies for transient stability analysis are carried out to validate the proposed coordinated control strategy and parameters tuning by PSO method. In the testing system, two offshore wind farms and one AC power grid are interconnected as the meshed structure via the 3-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system. The digital simulations are carried out with Matlab/Simulink.},

	abstract = {By taking Agricultural High-tech Industrial Park of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Wan Zhuang) and its peripheral regions with a total area of 4.2 × 3.1 km as the study area, this paper carried out an aerial photogrammetry experiment by using the RICOH GXR A12 camera carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and the experiment mainly tested the precisions of planar positioning under a POS (positioning and orientation system) supported bundle block adjustment method and of area measurement, as well as the precision of the crop area identification of an UAV orthophoto map obtained from an aerial triangulation correction. We use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to obtain 690 images which covered the whole study area. After a series of processes such as image screen, POS-supported aerial triangulation correction, digital elevation model making, image fusion, and digital differential rectification, we have obtained the ortho-photo map of the whole study area. Since the deployment of high precision ground control point wastes time and energy, POS-supported aerial triangulation employs a non-control point model. Therefore, its absolute positioning precision may be affected by the error of the GPS carried on an UAV. In order to eliminate this error, the project team used a high precision wordview image to rectify the ortho-photo map. In this way, we could improve the image positioning precision, and meanwhile unify the study sample areas with the overall larger scope image coordinate system, so as to provide high precision samples for large-scale agriculture remote sensing statistics and monitoring. The result shows that, under the condition of no control point and after direct POS data bundle block adjustment, the mean square error of plane positioning precision of the X axis direction is 2.29 m, Y direction is 2.78 m, and overall plane error is 3.61 m. If a three order general polynomial model is adopted to conduct a geometric precision correction, then the mean square error of the X axis direction is 1.59 m, the Y direction is 1.8965 m, and the mean square error of the overall plane is 2.32 m. The above figures conform to the 1:10 000 ground plane precision requirements specified in the 'Standard for Aerotriangulation of Digital Aerophotogrammetry' and can meet the positioning precision requirements of a crop area survey in remote sensing monitoring. After obtaining the ortho-photo map, the four ground objects in the area evaluation areas of spring corn, summer corn, alfalfa, and bare soil were classified by employing two methods of supervised classification and object-oriented classification. By taking the differential GPS survey results as the evaluation criteria, the overall precisions of the four crops reached 88.2% (supervised classification) and 92.0% (object-oriented classification) respectively. The separate classification precisions of the two classification methods of the four ground objects were 88.9%, 86.7%, 93.0%, 86.6%, and 90.35%, as well as 90.35%, 92.61%, 94.93%, and 93.30% respectively. The result showed that remote sensing images of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), by acquiring small scale and quadrat sampled crop images, have a prospect of wide application. After promotion, it can meet the demands of nationwide crop ground sampling on high spatial resolution images, and can partially replace the operation model of GPS measurement.},

	abstract = {To meet the need of high-precision navigation for HALE(high-altitude long-endurance) UAV(unmanned aerial vehicle), multi-sensor fault-tolerant autonomous navigation system was researched. For the shortcoming that the GPS signal is easily interfered by electromagnetic techniques, combining sundry integrated navigation patterns such as the INS/CNS integrated navigation, the INS/SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) integrated navigation, and other autonomous navigation system, the fault-tolerant federated filter scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme can effectively take advantage of multi-sensor information redundancy. When the GPS system failure occurred, the system can effectively detect and isolate the corresponding failure subsystem, and at this time the INS/CNS integrated navigation system plays a leading role in the navigation system to maintain a certain degree of navigation accuracy. By importing the SAR-aided navigation system in the terminal, the system can achieve high-precision navigation positioning. The integrated navigation system can detecte failure in rapid speed, so it has a high application value in practical engineering. The simulation results by covariance analysis show that the proposed navigation scheme is feasible, and this navigation scheme has important theoretical reference value to improve accuracy and reliability of integrated navigation system for the HALE UAV. ©2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In multi-agent systems, digital pheromone swarming algorithms are used to coordinate agents to achieve complex and intelligent behaviors. Studies have shown that pheromone swarming systems are versatile, efficient and resilient to failures, and thus are applicable in various scenarios such as border control, area coverage, target tracking, search and rescue, etc. Due to their reliance on wireless communication channels - which are vulnerable to interference and jamming attacks - it becomes important to study the security of these systems under malicious conditions. In this paper, we investigate the security of pheromone swarming under different types of jamming attacks. In particular, we expose new types of stealthy attacks that aim to maximize the damage inflicted on the swarm while reducing the risk of exposure. Unlike complete Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, the attacks exposed select which signal to interfere with based on the current state of the swarm. We have assessed the impact of the attacks through new metrics that expose the tradeoff between damage and cost. Our results show that the exposed attacks are more potent than traditional DoS-like attacks. Our results are obtained from simulation experiments and real physical implementation using a number of iRobot Create robots in our Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems lab. © 2013 IEEE.},

A stochastic programming model for spinning reserve of power grid connected with large-scale wind farms is built, which can flexibly allocate reliability weights in different time-intervals to implement the coordinated optimization of reliability within dispatching period. Fully considering cost differences among spinning reserves provided by different units, the built model permits units to bid prices of spinning reserves, and the minimization of generation cost, spinning reserve cost, and expected outage cost is taken as objective function to implement the maximization of whole economic benefits at generation side and consumer side. The built model can be applied to perform cost-benefit analysis for power grid containing wind farms and to provide decision-making foundation for dispatching departments to set reasonable reliability level. The built model is solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and the effectiveness of above-mentioned model and algorithm is verified by simulation results of a 10-machine system.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to analyze the inertial weight factor value in the (PSO) algorithm and propose non-linear weights with decreasing strategy to implement the improved PSO (IPSO) algorithm. Using various types of sensors, combined with ZigBee wireless sensor networks and the TCP/IP network. The GPRS/SMS long-range wireless network will sense the measured data analysis and evaluation to create more effective monitoring and observation in a regional environment to achieve an Internet of Things with automated information exchange between persons and things. Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a wireless sensor network system using ZigBee (PSoC-1605A) chip, sensor and circuit boards to constitute the IOT system. The IOT system consists of a main coordinator (PSoC-1605A), smart grid monitoring system, robotic arm detection warning system and temperature and humidity sensor network. The hardware components communicate with each other through wireless transmission. Each node collects data and sends messages to other objects in the network. Findings - This study employed IPSO to perform information fusion in a multi-sensor network. The paper shows that IPSO improved the measurement preciseness via weight factors estimated via experimental simulations. The experimental results show that the IPSO algorithm optimally integrates the weight factors, information source fusion reliability, information redundancy and hierarchical structure integration in uncertain fusion cases. The sensor data approximates the optimal way to extract useful information from each fusion data and successfully eliminates noise interference, producing excellent fusion results. Practical implications - Robotic arm to tilt detection warning system: Several geographic areas are susceptible to severe tectonic plate movement, often generating earthquakes. Earthquakes cause great harm to public infrastructure, and a great threat to high-tech, high-precision machinery and production lines. To minimize the extent of earthquake disasters and allow managers to deal with power failures, vibration monitoring system construction can enhance manufacturing process quality and stability. Smart grid monitoring system: The greenhouse effect, global energy shortage and rising cost of traditional energy are related energy efficiency topics that have attracted much attention. The aim of this paper is that real-time data rendering and analysis can be more effective in understanding electrical energy usage, resulting in a reduction in unnecessary consumption and waste. Temperature and humidity sensor network system: Environmental temperature and humidity monitoring and application of a wide range of precision industrial production lines, laboratories, antique works of art that have a higher standard of environmental temperature and humidity requirements. The environment has a considerable influence on biological lifeforms. The relative importance of environmental management and monitoring is acute. Originality/value - This paper improves the fixed inertial weight of the original particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. An illustration in the paper indicates that IPSO applies the Internet of Things (IOT) system in monitoring a system via adjusted weight factors better than other existing PSO methods in computing a precise convergence rate for excellent fusion results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, efficient collaborative coverage is challenging due to limited individual sensing, computing and communication resources of MAV sensor nodes, and lack of location infrastructure in the unknown application environment. We present SugarMap, a novel system that enables such resource-constrained MAV nodes to achieve efficient sensing coverage. The self-establishing system uses approximate motion models of mobile nodes in conjunction with radio signatures from self-deployed stationary anchor nodes to create a common coverage map. Consequently, the system coordinates node movements to reduce sensing overlap and increase the speed and efficiency of coverage. The system uses particle filters to account for uncertainty in sensors and actuation of MAV nodes, and incorporates redundancy to guarantee coverage. Through large-scale simulations and a real implementation on the SensorFly MAV sensing platform, we show that SugarMap provides better coverage than the existing coverage approaches for MAV swarms.

The camera pose angles and the focal lengths were precisely reckoned by the three images of the target and at least three identifiable common point coordinates among the images. Three-dimension coordinates of the ground target were calculated using forward intersection. The new method, which is independent of DEM and the measured values of camera pose angles, eliminates the two of the three primary error sources in the traditional UAV target location method and has better location precision.

	abstract = {In many research areas in the geo-sciences (erosion, land use, land cover change, etc.) or applications (e.g. forest management, mining, land management etc.) there is a demand for remote sensing images of a very high spatial and temporal resolution. Due to the high costs of classic aerial photo campaigns, the use of a UAV is a promising option for obtaining the desired remote sensed information at the time it is needed. However, the UAV must be easy to operate, safe, robust and should have a high payload and long flight time. For that purpose, the parachute UAV SUSI 62 was developed. It consists of a steel frame with a powerful 62 cm3 2-stroke engine and a parachute wing. The frame can be easily disassembled for transportation or to replace parts. On the frame there is a gimbal mounted sensor carrier where different sensors, standard SLR cameras and/or multi-spectral and thermal sensors can be mounted. Due to the design of the parachute, the SUSI 62 is very easy to control. Two different parachute sizes are available for different wind speed conditions. The SUSI 62 has a payload of up to 8 kg providing options to use different sensors at the same time or to extend flight duration. The SUSI 62 needs a runway of between 10 m and 50 m, depending on the wind conditions. The maximum flight speed is approximately 50 km/h. It can be operated in a wind speed of up to 6 m/s. The design of the system utilising a parachute UAV makes it comparatively safe as a failure of the electronics or the remote control only results in the UAV coming to the ground at a slow speed. The video signal from the camera, the GPS coordinates and other flight parameters are transmitted to the ground station in real time. An autopilot is available, which guarantees that the area of investigation is covered at the desired resolution and overlap. The robustly designed SUSI 62 has been used successfully in Europe, Africa and Australia for scientific projects and also for agricultural, forestry and industrial applications.},

It is also co-funded by European Regional Development Fund (E.R.D.F.) within the Regional Operative Program 2007/2013. The main objective of SMAT-F1 research project is monitoring the Piedmont environment, both to accomplish with planned tasks and to deal with emergencies or other kinds of anomalies; the system concept was driven with the idea of 3 different classes of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), each one with several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ((UAV )and its own Ground Control Station (GCS). The three GCS have to be interfaced with a single Station of Supervision and Control (SSC), to coordinate and control the operations of the whole system. The intrinsic complexity of the proposed system leads to the need of a thorough study about integration between the different assets playing working in this scenario, in terms of system availability and effectiveness; reaching the goal of a well-balanced system necessarily goes through the sizing of a proper logistic support system, in terms of operating and maintenance basis spread throughout the monitored territory, relative logistic resources amount, as well as the more convenient Reliability and Maintainability levels for various UAS and the best maintenance strategy for the 3 fleets. For this reason, considering the high number of choices available, it has been considered a simulation, through the implementation of a Monte-Carlo method, in order to verify the proposed model and define a complete operational environment for the described system.},

	abstract = {Recently a lot of studies and developments about distributed generator such as photovoltaic generation system, wind turbine generation system and fuel cell have been performed under the background of the global environment issues and deregulation of the electricity market, and the technique of these distributed generators have progressed. Especially, micro grid which consists of several distributed generators, loads and storage battery is expected as one of the new operation system of distributed generator. However, since precipitous load fluctuation occurs in micro grid for the reason of its smaller capacity compared with conventional power system, high-accuracy load forecasting and control scheme to balance of supply and demand are needed. Namely, it is necessary to improve the precision of operation in micro grid by observing load fluctuation and correcting start-stop schedule and output of generators online. But it is not easy to determine the operation schedule of each generator in short time, because the problem to determine start-up, shut-down and output of each generator in micro grid is a mixed integer programming problem. In this paper, the authors propose an online optimization method for the optimal operation schedule of generators in micro grid. The proposed method is based on enumeration method and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In the proposed method, after picking up all unit commitment patterns of each generators satisfied with minimum up time and minimum down time constraint by using enumeration method, optimal schedule and output of generators are determined under the other operational constraints by using PSO. Numerical simulation is carried out for a micro grid model with five generators and photovoltaic generation system in order to examine the validity of the proposed method. © 2008 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

On the basis of the overall structure of UAV EODP, a target localization model is established according to the mapping relationship of the target from the geodetic coordinate system to photo-sensor coordinate system. The 9 factors, including UAV position and attitude error, EODP angle, range error and etc., are selected as variables; a target localization error calculation formula is derived. The flight experiment data are used to verify the effectiveness of this error calculation method. With simulation experiments, the influence of UAV position, attitude angle error, electro-optical sensor azimuth angle and elevation angle errors and laser ranging error on localization precision is analyzed; at the same time, the relationship between the measuring point of UAV and localization precision in actual application is pointed out: the lower the plane and the larger the pointing angle, the higher the target localization precision.},

A number of beacons were placed on the body of the tanker as pre-set feature points, with a camera installed on the nose of the UAV to capture images of the tanker. Feature points were extracted and matched with coordinates derived from the camera imaging model. After elimination of gross matching errors, the relative pose information between the tanker and the UAV was calculated by an iterative algorithm. A three-dimensional visual simulation system based on Vega Prime showed that this method could provide six degrees of freedom information on the relative position and orientation. The position measurements have the required accuracy, while the mean absolute measurement error of the attitude angle is less than 1 degree. This method meets the accuracy requirement of AAR and has good fault-tolerance for loss or mismatch of feature points.},

	abstract = {In the smart grid, the large scale wind power penetration tends to expand vastly. Nevertheless, due to the intermittent power generation from wind, this may cause a problem of large frequency fluctuation when the load-frequency control (LFC) capacity is not enough to compensate the unbalance of generation and load demand. Also, in the future transport sector, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is widely expected for driving in the customer side. Generally, the power of PHEV is charged by plugging into the home outlets as the dispersed battery energy storages. Therefore, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power control can be applied to compensate for the inadequate LFC capacity. This paper focuses on the new coordinated V2G control and conventional frequency controller for robust LFC in the smart grid with large wind farms. The battery state-of-charge (SOC) is controlled by the optimized SOC deviation control. The structure of frequency controller is a proportional integral (PI) with a single input. To enhance the robust performance and robust stability against the system uncertainties, the PI controller parameters and the SOC deviation are optimized simultaneously by the particle swarm optimization based on the fixed structure mixed H2/H\infty control. Simulation results show the superior robustness and control effect of the proposed coordinated controllers over the compared controllers. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The objective of this project is to define a science which allows for the evolution of complex software systems that can fully utilize massively parallel computers of ever-greater capability (initially dual quad cores running fewer higher-level sensors for tractability) and employ this design in human-robot interaction with a final goal of full autonomy of the robot (in this case, an unmanned helicopter). Briefly, the greater the number of processors, the less the chance of error and the better the analogical match that can be found in the processing time allowed. Clearly, any practical science of design should allow the human in the loop to do what he/she does best while at the same time utilize the robot to do what it does best. Such an eminently practical symbiosis is based on the science of randomization as defined by Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Rubin, Solomonoff, and Uspenskii [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Here, repetitive or symmetric actions such as testing evolutionary alternatives are carried out by a fast computer, while novel or -random actions such as that of providing a model definition are realized by the human. Autonomous behavior may be determined by the interaction of simple heuristics, rather than through the design of complex software that is difficult to maintain. The emergent behavior of simple heuristics is not only universal, but potentially at least as complex as that of any other design for the realization of software control systems. While any autonomous vehicle equipped with suitable sensors can be autonomously guided by an appropriate set of heuristics, the acquisition of such a base has proven to be elusive to date. This document provides a forum for some preliminary results in the area of knowledge amplification as well as a setting for projected future research in the area of intelligence. The problems encountered in developing a set of heuristics to guide an autonomous vehicle include: Rules are too crisp and not sufficiently flexible to cover real-world situations. No one knows all of the rules needed in advance. Fuzzy logic only addresses quantitative aspects of the rules; whereas, the qualitative aspects are at least as important. Conventional rule acquisition is slow and otherwise impractical. Neural networks cannot plan effectively. Neural networks cannot learn nearly fast enough to be used in conjunction with a human trainer. Cases cannot be autonomously adapted, which limits the applicability of CBR here. Systems do not grow their knowledge bases by sharing, which limits the acquisition of knowledge by swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Algorithmic control aspects need to be processed separately and locally. No one would be a pilot if they lacked common sense. They can learn how to fly, but without common sense, they are preordained to fail. Yet, our predecessors have sought to build UAVs that are lacking in this most critical capability - presumably because they are of the mistaken belief that computers can never exhibit commonsense reasoning beyond that for which they are explicitly programmed. However, knowledge amplifiers, known as KASERs, have been designed and patented by one of the authors [6] and elsewhere, which allow for the symmetric expansion of a knowledge base - enabling heuristic programs to reason by analogy - just like human pilots. Applications for autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles such as the UAVs that support the US military in reconnaissance missions (Predator and the GlobalHawk, for example) or could support our civilian forces using autonomous robot colonies (in rescue missions such as the events surrounding the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City bombing, or in homeland security, for example) continue to spurn new research and development efforts in intelligent agents, light-weight material, fuel-cell based propulsion, hybrid engine designs, smart sensor networks, secure wireless communication networks, and energy-efficient computing architectures. Further, with the advent of advances in nanotechnology and microsystems, several research teams continue to investigate the integration of such technologies for small swarms of AVs or SAVs for military, commercial, and civilian applications. SSC-PAC has designed, developed, patented, and in some cases transitioned intelligent systems, which serve to automate the creation, testing, and maintenance of complex software systems. Subsequently, the co-authors have collaborated on the construction of a Cognitive KASER for learning and have investigated its application to such areas as web searching and decision support architectures. A brief summary of the work in knowledge amplification is provided in Section III. In summary, in order to test a new learning approach that can bestow intelligence on a system, based upon human (tutor) - robot (student) interaction, we are working jointly to design an intelligent system architecture, based on the KASER, and plan to implement the methodology on an aerial vehicle (a helicopter), which will execute several maneuvers such as basic hovering, steep approach, confined area approach, and basic altitude flying. The software to perform these maneuvers will be developed using two methods (teach mode with a human-in-the-loop) and classical control. Then, the knowledge amplification system will autonomously generate another set of software, which will then be tested and compared to the execution of the baseline two software codes using the same helicopter flight scenarios. We anticipate that such complex functional real-time software can be most cost-effectively written through the use of a software-writing system embodying knowledge amplification. © 2011 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

In order to improve the security of UAV landing on the flight strip, a vision-based method was presented for attitude and position estimation of it, based a few feature points distributed on the ground arbitrarily. Calculating the attitude and position relative to runway is the core. Firstly, the coordinates in the camera frame of the feature points was acquired with the N-point algorithm; secondly, with the orthogonalization method, the rotation matrix and the translation vector between the camera frame and the runway frame were acquired. For the imaging process of feature points is influenced by noise, the least-median-squares (LMS) algorithm was employed to diminish the influence of noise and to improve the robustness. For improving the efficiency of LMS, the data segmentation technology was used. The simulation indicated that the presented algorithms meet the precision demand of UAV landing. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an important and expanding role in both civilian and military missions, such as search and rescue, intelligence collection, surveillance, or reconnaissance. Currently, UAVs require human operators to control and direct their flights and sensors. To expand their effectiveness and exploit their inherent capabilities, we seek to develop robust techniques for multiple UAVs to cooperatively operate without direct human control. Our current research interest is to develop algorithms and simulate techniques to enable UAVs to search for, detect, and locate mobile ground targets emitting radio frequency signals. This paper investigates the task of combining sensor data from multiple UAVs to obtain accurate and reliable target locations. The sensors collect only coarse angle-of-arrival information and we apply Kalman filtering techniques to estimate the angle to the target. The estimated angles from multiple UAVs are sufficient to develop control laws for the UAVs to converge on an orbit about the target and collect additional measurements to further improve the estimation of the target's position. We explore a sensor fusion process embedded in a simple control law that allows multiple UAVs to cooperate in the target localization task and coordinate their motion using a leader-follower approach. We demonstrate the cooperative sensing techniques using simulation results. © 2007 IEEE.},

The SkyObserver project is aimed to develop a tool for emergency management based on an autonomous swarm to deal with various tasks in the case of a civil hazard. In these and similar tasks the deployment and exploration problems are critical challenges in the coordination and path planning of an autonomous swarm. Additionally robustness and scalability requirements have to be taken into account. This paper gives an overview of available and suitable methods and algorithms solving the deployment and exploration problems in context of civil operations.

In allusion to the poor adaptation of spinning reserve capacity determined by traditional experience method, that is needed by power system, based on the interval prediction of wind power output and load demand the positive- and negative-spinning reserve capacity determined by extreme scenario theory is used to coordinate the randomness of wind power output and load. To remedy the defect that in existing unit ramp rate constraint only single single-period unit regulation is considered and to avoid the regulation of units exceeds the limit while abrupt fluctuations of wind power output and load occur, multi-period coupling constraints are added to balance the fluctuation between wind power output and load. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to solve the proposed model and the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by simulation results of IEEE 30-bus system with wind farms.},

	abstract = {The coming interaction between a growing electrified vehicle fleet and the desired growth in renewable energy provides new insights into the economic dispatch (ED) problem. This paper presents an economic dispatch model that considers electric vehicle charging, battery exchange stations, and wind farms. This ED model is a high-dimensional, non-linear, and stochastic problem and its solution requires powerful methods. A new finite action-set learning automata (FALA)-based approach that has the ability to adapt to a stochastic environment is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a modified IEEE 30 bus system. It is compared with continuous action-set learning automata and particle swarm optimization-based approaches in terms of convergence characteristics, computational efficiency, and solution quality. Simulation results show that the proposed FALA-based approach was indeed capable of more efficiently obtaining the approximately optimal solution. In addition, by using an optimal dispatch schedule for the interaction between electric vehicle stations and power systems, it is possible to reduce the gap between demand and power generation at different times of the day. © 2014 by the authors.},

Others include UAV/satellite forest fire monitoring, international students/post-doc research, sustainable green construction, point-to-point sub-orbital flight, ocean monitoring, autonomous SoC development, and bio-fuels and other biotech projects. Offset projects can take advantage of resources made available during large international procurements. SBSP has been talked about many times since Peter Glaser's invention of the concept over 40 years ago, however there still has not been a single SBSP watt transmitted down from orbit. Students at San Jose State University have been researching the feasibility of a SBSP demonstration, using either the International Space Station or a small satellite in LEO. The research for the SBSP demonstration has also helped to develop the concept of on-orbit cloud computing, and both concepts can be utilized for lunar applications. The SBSP demonstration is important because the necessary efficiencies and losses have not yet been clearly established and is being developed to beam 200 watts of power to Earth's surface, estimating 25% efficiency due to atmospheric losses and laser conversion losses. All technology needed for the demonstration exists. The cost, schedule and other programmatic elements of this demonstration will be provided. International offset can be a source of funding for this demonstration. SBSP and on-orbit cloud computing are both important concepts involving sustainable energy, thereby contributing to world peace, because they both make use of the abundant, renewable energy source of the Sun.},

	abstract = {To alleviate the impacts of stochastic wind generation on stability performance, this paper proposes a novel control design method for coordination and synthesis of damping controllers for conventional synchronous generators (SG) and double fed induction generators (DFIG)-based wind generation in multi-machine power systems. A probabilistic model of wind generation under Weibull distribution of wind speed is first introduced. Based on this model, an extended probabilistic small signal stability analysis (SSSA) incorporating wind power generation is proposed for handling probability density function (PDF) of its power output. The optimization problem for tuning of damping controllers is then formulated, considering the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the real part and damping ratio of eigenvalues obtained by the proposed probabilistic SSSA as stability constraints. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the optimization problem and to determine parameters of damping controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on the modified New England power system with multi-wind farms through probabilistic SSSA and transient stability analysis, and it is compared with conventional deterministic methods. Accuracy of the proposed probabilistic SSSA is also validated by Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and in particular quad-rotors represent novel platforms to accomplish a wide set of missions as surveillance, Search & Rescue, inspection, pho-togrammetry. The main limitation of these vehicles is represented by the restricted operating area. The area is mainly limited by power supplies (batteries or fuel). A strategy to overcame this limitation is to increase the number of vehicles forming a coalition. The main benefit of coalition formation are the extended mission range and the capability to increase the sensorial set. Each vehicles is a part of a dynamic network that must be properly coordinated in order to optimize all the available resources. In this paper a new framework for simulation of unmanned vehicles in cooperative scenarios is first presented. The framework is based on the interaction of a physics-engine, which simulates the dynamics of vehicles and their interaction with world increasing the realism of simulation, and a simulation environment where the high-level strategy is designed/developed. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) is then introduced to solve the problem of leader-follower applied to quad-rotors. Using the developed framework and the MPC technique is possible to easily instantiate the coalition minimizing also a cost function. The obtained results from the control strategy point of view show that positioning error at steady state is equal to zero. The MPC allows also the modelling of different conflicting constraints as the control actions, positioning error, and fuel/energy consumption. © 2011 by ASME.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new technique for coordinating teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when deployed to collect live aerial imagery of the scene of a disaster. We define this problem as one of task assignment where the UAVs dynamically coordinate over tasks representing the imagery collection requests. To measure the quality of the assignment of one or more UAVs to a task, we propose a novel utility function which encompasses several constraints, such as the task's importance and the UAVs' battery capacity so as to maximise performance. We then solve the resulting optimisation problem using a fully asynchronous and decentralised implementation of the max-sum algorithm, a well known message passing algorithm previously used only in simulated domains. Finally, we evaluate our approach both in simulation and on real hardware. First, we empirically evaluate our utility and show that it yields a better trade off between the quantity and quality of completed tasks than similar utilities that do not take all the constraints into account. Second, we deploy it on two hexacopters and assess its practical viability in the real world. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The problem of searching for a missing person in a wilderness search and rescue application is often modelled as a straightforward application of Bayes' Rule to a conventional occupancy grid. However, this model fails to exploit many potentially valuable secondary cues - such as material dropped by the missing person or unmarked tracks - which could aid in the search process. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach to exploit this secondary evidence. Our approach is inspired by the stigmergic approach to indirect coordination: evidence left by the missing person on the ground is used to coordinate the actions with the searching UAV. To achieve this coordination, we compute the joint probability over multiple cells using a path-base representation of the missing person trajectory. The trajectory is modelled using an agent-based simulation. As new evidence becomes available, a resampling scheme is used to update the ensemble of paths. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in a simple search scenario, and show a significant improvement over current search methods.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of coordinating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for a precision agriculture application. In this application, the ground and aerial measurements are used for estimating nitrogen (N) levels on-demand across a farm. Our goal is to estimate the N map over a field and classify each point based on N deficiency levels. These estimates in turn guide fertilizer application. Applying the right amount of fertilizer at the right time can drastically reduce fertilizer usage. Towards building such a system, this paper makes the following contributions: First, we present a method to identify points whose probability of being misclassified is above a threshold. Second, we study the problem of maximizing the number of such points visited by an UAV subject to its energy budget. The novelty of our formulation is the capability of the UGV to mule the UAV to deployment points. This allows the system to conserve the short battery life of a typical UAV. Third, we introduce a new path planning problem in which the UGV must take a measurement within a disk centered at each point visited by the UAV. The goal is to minimize the total time spent in traveling and measuring. For both problems, we present constant-factor approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our system with simulations which use manually collected soil measurements from the field. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Large-scale integration of wind power in the electricity system presents some planning and operational difficulties, which are mainly due to the intermittent and difficult nature of wind prediction process. Therefore it is considered as an unreliable energy source. This paper presents a new approach for solving the generation scheduling (GS) problem. It will consider the reserve requirement, load balance and wind power availability constraints. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is suggested to deal with the equality and inequality constraints in the GS problem. The proposed PSO is applied to a 12-unit test system (including 10 conventional thermal generating units and 2 wind farms) to determine the acceleration constants of proposed PSO and the global variant-based passive congregation PSO (GPAC). Employing these constants which correspond to the best total cost function, the performance of proposed PSO and GPAC are determined, through comparison of their results for three specific test systems. Evaluation of the solution for these test systems demonstrates that near optimal schedules are obtained with application of proposed PSO. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In view of the potentials and benefits of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civil and surveillance applications, such as forest fire monitoring and fighting, earthquake and natural disasters monitoring and sensing etc., the cooperative flight of multiple UAVs has been paid more and more attention. Among the applications of multiple UAVs in cooperative flight, fault-tolerant cooperative localization against global positioning system (GPS) signal loss due to GPS receiver malfunction is one of key techniques for various practical applications. The current research on fault-tolerant cooperative localization of UAVs is mainly based on the distance between UAVs. However, cooperative localization based on the azimuth angles between UAVs has not been generally researched so far. This paper aims to solve the problem of fault-tolerant cooperative localization of UAVs by introducing the azimuth angles between UAVs. Firstly, the basic localization model is established and the formulas of localization in two and three dimensional coordinate systems are derived. Then the optimal reference planes are chosen with the principle of minimum horizontal dilution of positioning (HDOP). Kalman filter is applied to decrease the influence of observation errors on localization. Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter are designed against linear and non-linear systems, respectively. Finally, the simulation results indicate that the cooperative localization based on the azimuth angles achieves high localization accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Short-term prediction of wind speed is important to the power system operation. Generation schedules in a wind farm could be efficiently assigned by means of precise prediction of wind speed to alleviate the impact of instable wind power on power grids. Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is a main approach for short-term wind speed prediction. The method, using the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm to train the BPNN, is proposed in this paper. The model of wind speed prediction also takes meteorological factors like temperature into consideration. The performance of BPNN, PSO based BPNN and IPSO based BPNN for one-hour ahead forcasting of wind speed have been examined with real data. Simulation results clearly indicate the advantage of IPSO based BPNN over the other two methods in convergence speed and prediction precision. ©2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without onboard human pilot, which motion can be remotely and / or autonomously controlled. Using multiple UAVs, i.e. a fleet, offers various advantages compared to the single UAV scenario, such as longer mission duration, bigger mission area or the load balancing of the mission payload. For collaboration purposes, it is assumed that the UAVs are equipped with ad hoc communication capabilities and thus form a special case of mobile ad hoc networks. However, the coordination of one or more fleets of UAVs, in order to fulfill collaborative missions, raises multiples issues in particular when UAVs are required to act in an autonomous fashion. Thus, we propose a decentralised and localised algorithm to control the mobility of the UAVs. This algorithm is designed to perform surveillance missions with network connectivity constraints, which are required in most practical use cases for security purposes as any UAV should be able to be contacted at any moment in case of an emergency. The connectivity is maintained via a tree-based overlay network, which root is the base station of the mission, and created by predicting the future positions of one-hop neighbours. This algorithm is compared to the state of the art contributions by introducing new quality metrics to quantify different aspect of the area coverage process (speed, exhaustivity and fairness). Numerical results obtained via simulations show that the maintenance of the connectivity has a slight negative impact on the coverage performances while the connectivity performances are significantly better. © 2013 ACM.},

The UAV is utilized as a leader robot that is intelligently followed by a coordinated group of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). The UAV is a completely autonomous agent that is controlled using Sugueno fuzzy logic. The UGVs are organized into formation utilizing artificial potential fields generated from normal and sigmoid functions. These functions are built around the location of the UAV and ultimately construct the surface that swarm members travel on, which inherently controls the overall swarm geometry and the individual member spacing. Nonlinear limiting functions are defined to provide tighter swarm control by modifying and adjusting a set of control variables forcing the swarm to behave according to set constraints, formation and member spacing. The swarm function and limiting functions are combined to control swarm formation, orientation, and swarm movement as a whole. Parameters are chosen based on desired formation as well as user defined constraints. Simulations demonstrate the precision of the approach with up to forty UGVs. Experimental results are presented using a fully autonomous swarm of three UGVs and a single UAV helicopter for coordination.},

The new method combines the ESMF based cooperative observation method and the LP-based trajectory generation method in RVCs, where the ESMF based cooperative method is used to obtain the moving target's motion state which is further used as part of the cost function to plan the UAV's behavior by using the planning method in RVCs. The contribution of this paper is: 1) the computational burden of the proposed cooperative algorithm is comparable to single ESMF algorithm; 2) the high precision observation of moving target is always obtainable by considering the optimal observation condition during trajectory planning; 3) the planning algorithm in RVCs, where the trajectory planning can be modeled as a LP problem, is used to optimize the UAV's behavior, thus, in company with 1), the fast application of the new proposed active cooperative observation method is desirable. Finally, the simulations in 3D environments are conducted to verify the feasibility and validity of the method. ©2009 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To realize fast and accurate evaluation for flatness errors, a Modified Artificial Bee Colony (MABC) algorithm was proposed to implement the minimum zone evaluation of flatness errors. The minimum zone method and the criteria for flatness errors were introduced. According to the minimum zone condition, the mathematic model of flatness error evaluation was presented. By introducing two traction bees and a Tabu Strategy (TS), this modified method could enhance the rate of convergence and the quality of optimum solution. The implementation steps of the method were expounded. Then, two test functions were selected in the simulation experiments through analysis, and the results verified the feasibility of MABC algorithm. Finally, proposed approach was used to evaluate flatness errors. The results calculated meet the criterion of minimal condition. On the basis of a group of metrical data, this approach can find the optimal plane by 0.436 second, which saves 0.411 second as compared with that of ABC algorithm. In addition, the flatness value from the MABC algorithm is 18.03 μm lower than that of the Least-Square Method (LSM), and 6.13 μm than the Genetic Algorithm (GA). According to other five measurement data sets available from the Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs), the results obtained by the MABC algorithm are more accurate than those by the GA and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the maximum gap of flatness values is 0.9 μm. Experimental results show that the MABC-based approach outperforms ABC-base method in optimization efficiency, solution quality and stability, and its calculating precision is superior to that given by LSM, GA or PSO. It is suited for the evaluation of position measuring instruments and CMMs.},

	abstract = {With the increasing scale of grid-connected wind farms, reasonably coordinating wind farm output with traditional power sources becomes a new challenge that power system dispatching has to be faced with. By means of defining real-time expected demand not supplied (REDNS) the risk level of power system real-time response can be measured, on this basis a risk level constraint of real-time response is put forward and brought into the dispatching. Comparing with deciding system reserve capacity by deterministic method, utilizing risk level constraint of real-time response can make the risk levels in all time intervals within the dispatching cycle consistent, so the system reserve capacity can be automatically adjusted. Under the premise that the wind power possesses the priority of grid-connection, reducing economic indices of system operation and ensuring the smooth running of thermal- and hydro-generating units are taken as the objective, a multi-objective coordinated optimal dispatching model for wind-thermal-hydro power system is constructed. Through leading in the learner phase of teaching-learning algorithm and constructing independent backup selection set, the performance of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is improved and a new multi-objective particle swarm optimization (NMPSO) is proposed. Adding a wind farm into standard 10-machine test system, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method and model are validated by simulation results.},

This paper deals with the problem of economic optimal operation of CHP system consisting of wind turbine, PV, fuel cell, waste heat boiler, gas boiler, battery, thermal and electric load. Chance constrained programming (CCP) is utilized to consider the random feature wind power, PV power, thermal and electric load.

	abstract = {Reconfigurable systems are a class of systems that can be transformed into different configurations, generally to perform unique functions or to maintain operational efficiency under distinct conditions. In this paper, we perform the conceptual design of a new offline- reconfigurable Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform that can take up both a quadrotor UAV (QR-UAV) configuration and a fixed-wing UAV (FW-UAV) configuration. Potential uses of such an offline reconfigurable UAV, which provides both VTOL/hovering capabilities and long-endurance/range capabilities, include hazard-critical survey applications in remote locations (e.g., surveying wildfires). This UAV platform is comprised of modules that can be assembled/re-assembled to form the FW and QR configurations (as needed). The entire set of modules are designed to be as light as possible (allowing to be carried in backpacks), and the FW and QR configurations are required to satisfy different endurance specifications (60 mins and 15 mins). A novel combination of exploratory 3D CAD modeling and modular product platform planning is adopted for the conceptual design of the offline reconfigurable FW-QR UAV. Conceived through the 3D CAD modeling process, the QR configuration comprises four ducted rotors, a central pod (with onboard electronics), and a battery; in addition to all the components in the QR configuration, the FW configuration includes flying wing and tail sections, with the ducted rotors mounted under the wing. The modules are attached using a robust lock-pin mechanism, conceived through the 3D CAD modeling process. The modular platform planning process promote the sharing of the maximum number of modules without compromising the performances of the individual configurations, and while minimizing the net weight and net cost of all the modules. The UAV modules are defined in terms of 15 design variables, and the subsequent mixed-integer non-linear optimization is performed using the mixed-discrete Particle Swarm algorithm. Significant design improvements of 41% weight reduction and 38% cost reduction are accomplished through optimization. © 2014 by Souma Chowdhury.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel control paradigm is considered for management of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation control based on multilevel hierarchy. Formation discipline is crucial to the safety and coordinated control of flight teams for both manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. The precision of a formation is maintained by the formation leader's complete knowledge and control of the actions of each UAV. We introduce the concept of hierarchical control strategy for management of multiple semi-autonomous UAVs that reflects a fractal pattern of command and control at each echelon in a multiple-UAV theater of operations. We have developed, in simulation, a system that treats each UAV as a group, each flight of UAVs as a group of subgroups (individual UAVs), each squadron as a group of subgroups (flights), etc. Under command from a human operator or automated control algorithm, each group level can detach from one group to join a different group or change hierarchical level. The suggested hierarchical, pseudo-fractal control algorithm simplifies command and control of multiple, heterogeneous, autonomous vehicles. With this structure, a single operator or small team could control multiple UAVs effectively. The developed algorithms are applicable to multiple ground vehicles and spacecraft formations as well.},

	abstract = {Iron and steel works is not only major energy-consuming polluters but also a major source of pollutants. The boiler of power plant should be operated under the optimal scheme to meet the varying demand and power from process to reduce cost and save energy for petrochemical industry. A multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model for the boiler load with environmental costs was established and solved by using the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm. The results indicate: the fuel cost is 1015 611 Yuan after optimization, about 77% in the whole running system. The total cost is less than the actual cost 50462. 864 Yuan approximately, decreased by about 3. 7%, saving a lot of cost. The feasibility and rationality of the model is solved based on the IPSO method, a better operational planning is attained to provide guidance quantificationally for the operating plan. Although considering environmental costs as part of the total cost increases the total business operating costs, to resolve the issue of environmental protection and coordinated and sustainable economic and social development has important significance.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of wind power in the future smart grid may considerably affect the system frequency. Especially, the frequency fluctuation may be severe when the capacity of generators for load-frequency control (LFC) is insufficient in the nighttime. In general, the battery energy storage system (BESS) is used to alleviate the frequency fluctuation. Nevertheless, the installation cost of BESS with large capacity is very high. On the other hand, in the demand side, the installation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) tends to increase significantly. The PHEV is normally plugged into the home outlet in the nighttime. Based on the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control, the distributed batteries installed in PHEVs can be applied to LFC. As a result, the required capacity of BESS installed in the system can be reduced. This paper proposes the new contribution of the PHEV based on V2G control not only to alleviate frequency fluctuation in a smart grid with large wind farms, but also to reduce the BESS capacity. In the PHEV model, the charging schedule and battery state of charge are taken into account. To guarantee the well cooperative control of PHEV, BESS and conventional frequency controller, the proportionalintegral parameters of BESS and frequency controller are tuned by the particle swarm optimization while the V2G control of PHEV is performed. Simulation study confirms that the PHEV can effectively cooperate with BESS and frequency controller for alleviation of frequency fluctuation. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the required capacity of BESS. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) have enjoyed an unprecedented popularity this last decade mainly due to their autonomy, low risk associated with hazardous operations, and relatively low operational cost. UAV missions range from very simple to extremely sophisticated operations. UAVs are being used in search and rescue operations, highway traffic monitoring, terrain surveillance, and target identification. In military application, UAVs are used for all above operations as well as weapon delivery. Despite many years of research and development, UAVs are still limited in range, agility, performance, reliability, and mission complexity. Researchers are still daunted by many problems related to controls, guidance, navigation, and autonomous functions. AUS is addressing many of these problems by designing and building a cost effective UAV Testbed where several fixed wing as well as rotary wing UAVs can be efficiently designed, tested, and validated. The Model Based Design methodology is adopted as to accelerate the design process of UAV systems and execute design plans in a timely manner. Hardware in the Loop Simulation (HILS) is conducted using the latest embedded system hardware and the latest software tools. The Testbed is made up of several off-the-shelve hardware components and numerous software modules. Most software tools used in the design process are commercial tools, while most of the communication modules and drivers are developed in house. A lightweight fixed wing UAV has been designed, integrated, and test flown using this newly designed test station. The UAV successfully navigated through waypoints autonomously. While airborne, an in board camera took several videos that were streamed live to a ground station. Results have shown that the Testbed has significantly improved the efficiency of the design process. A major enhancement in early error detection has also been observed.},

	abstract = {UAVs are promising platforms for various missions such as remote sensing of agricultural products, forest fire surveillance, search-and-rescue and border monitoring. A relevant common challenge in the above missions is that of convergence to an objective circular orbit. To address this challenge for fixed-wing UAVs, intrinsic constraints such as nonholonomic nature of the vehicle, minimum and maximum forward velocity, maximum angular velocity and limited detection range must be considered. In this paper, a decentralized coordination strategy is developed so that a number of fixed-wing UAVs converge to an objective circle, respecting the mentioned constraints. Also, a priority-based collision avoidance scheme is proposed to avoid inter-UAV collision. Convergence of the system is proved by analysis of the finite state machine associated with the coordination algorithm. Simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. © IFAC.},

A variety of service programs associated with airships exist today, however, none are directly linked to live force experimentation with operational units, to being tested synergistically with legacy forces through modeling and simulation, and to dedicated research, seminars and wargames. Most of the airship activities and research are at the lab and systems command level, where there is little operational context or interaction with the fleet - no "pull" from the operating fleet occurs, nor does data "push" to the fleet. Airships offer unique capabilities: safety of flight, long endurance, early on station ability, fuel efficiency, ability to land in geographically inhospitable areas, significantly closer "staring"advantage and larger-than-heavier-thanair payloads. Two years of investigation by Navy Warfare Development Command into airships recently culminated in a multi-service, multi-agency workshop that identified significant interest for both military and scientific experimentation with airships with various payloads. These payloads would include a range of sensor packages including, but not limited to: radio frequency (RF), electro-optical (EO), acoustic, passive coherent locating (PCL), laser, chemical, magnetic, visual and cybernetic. Various missions would be tested, to include: homeland defense (HLS), anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, theater air missile defense, C4ISR, anti-small boat swarm operations, information operations (to include deception operations), SLOC protection/interdiction, martime interception operations (MIO), scouting/reconnaissance, search and rescue (SAR), maritime exclusion zone/embargo enforcement and escort. Airship experimentation would complement both existing and POM forces, as well as postulated Navy After Next capabilities.},

We describe the system architecture, software and hardware components, and overall system integration. We then derive high-fidelity models that are validated with hardware-in-the-loop simulations and actual experiments. Our models are hybrid, capturing not only the physical dynamics of the aircraft, but also the mode switching logic that supervises lower level controllers. We conclude with a description of cooperative control experiments involving two fixed-wing UAVs.},

	abstract = {Most forms of swarm coordination require frequently updated relative position and posture information about at least all near neighbours. The Serafina project [1][2] considers comparatively small submersibles (40 cm in lengths) but in large numbers. This imposes constraints in terms of size and energy consumption of the components. It also requires high degrees of flexibility as the school configuration changes frequently and fast. This article suggests a low-cost localization method which involves the communication system [3] and fuses information on the longwave radio band with wide-band acoustic readings in order to generate range, bearing, and posture estimates of all surrounding submersibles, i.e. all submersibles in sensing range. MLS- (maximum lengths sequence) signals are employed for high interference robustness and deployability even in cluttered environments which usually impose multiple specular reflections and possible resonance effects. A number of physical experiments are discussed which tests for precision, sensing range, interference robustness, and motion sensitivity. All those experiments refer to inter-school localization. Absolute localization (with respect to external, global landmarks) need only to be solved for one of the submersibles in the school (as all internal, relative locations are known) and is not discussed in this article. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Inexpensive fixed wing UAVs are increasingly useful in remote sensing operations. They are a cheaper alternative to manned vehicles, and are ideally suited for dangerous or monotonous missions that would be inadvisable for a human pilot. Groups of UAVs are of special interest for their abilities to coordinate simultaneous coverage of large areas, or cooperate to achieve goals such as mapping. Cooperation and coordination in UAV groups also allows increasingly large numbers of aircraft to be operated by a single user. Specific applications under consideration for groups of cooperating UAVs are border patrol, search and rescue, surveillance, communications relaying, and mapping of hostile territory. The capabilities of small UAVs continue to grow with advances in wireless communications and computing power. Accordingly, research topics in cooperative UAV control include efficient computer vision for real-time navigation and networked computing and communication strategies for distributed control, as well as traditional aircraft-related topics such as collision avoidance and formation flight. Emerging results in cooperative UAV control are presented via discussion of these topics, including particular requirements, challenges, and some promising strategies relating to each area. Case studies from a variety of programs highlight specific solutions and recent results, ranging from pure simulation to control of multiple UAVs. This wide range of case studies serves as an overview of current problems of interest, and does not present every relevant result.},

The UC problem is decomposed into two embedded optimization subproblems: a unit on/off status schedule problem with integer variables that can be solved by the BPSO method and an economic dispatch problem with continuous that can be solved by the standard PSO method. At the same time the swap mutation operator based on the priority-ranked and repair strategy are introduced, which can be effectively dealt with the minimum up/down time constraints and enhance the algorithm's global optimal performance and computational efficiency. The feasibility and validity of the method is demonstrated for 10-unit system, and the test results are compared with those previously reported methods. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of solution's precision and convergence property.},

	abstract = {The field element of the U.S. Army Research Lab (ARL) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona is concerned with the manning required to operate the close-range Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV). The operational requirements of the TUAV operators may include extended duty days, reduced crew size and varying shift schedules. These conditions are likely to reduce operator effectiveness due to fatigue. The objective of this study was to analyze how fatigue, crew size, and rotation schedule affect operator workload and performance during the control of a TUAV. The conclusions from executing the models indicate that reducing the number of operators currently recommended for the control of TUAVs results in 1) 33% more aerial vehicle (AV) mishaps during emergencies, 2) a 13% increase in the time it takes to search for targets, and 3) an 11% decrease in the number of targets detected. Over 400 mission scenario replications of the model were executed allowing statistically reliable predictions to be made of the effect of operator fatigue on performance. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models may provide a cost effective means to estimate the impact of human limitations on military systems and highlight performance areas needing attention.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a project to implement necrophoric bee behaviour in a robot swarm. Pheromone communication is an effective means of coordinating the activities of insect colonies including food gathering, alarm and defense, reproduction and recognition of conspecifics. In a similar manner it is anticipated that pheromones will provide a valuable form of communication between robots. In order to investigate the problems and potential for this form of interaction, it was decided to implement an example of pheromone communication in a physical robotic system. Inspiration for this project came from the necrophoric behaviour of bees. The necrophoric pheromone released by dead bees triggers corpse removal behaviour in passing worker bees. In the context of a robot swarm one of the proposed applications for this behaviour is to locate and rescue disabled robots that release a pheromone as a form of distress signal. This paper provides details of the swarm robots used in the project, their sensors and the simple reactive control algorithm that was developed to mimic the necrophoric behaviour of bees. Results of practical experiments and simulations are also given. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {The study of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been an active research topic in recent years due to the rapid growth of UAS real-world applications driven by the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). UAS are defined as a complete unmanned system including control station, data links, and vehicle. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) refers to the vehicle element of the UAS. Currently UAS operate standalone, independent of neighboring UAS and used primarily for reconnaissance. However UAS roles are expanding to the point where UAV swarms will operate as cooperative autonomous units. The reason is that cooperatively controlled multiple UAS have the potential to complete mission critical complicated tasks with the higher efficiency and failure tolerance, such as coordinated navigation to a target, coordinated terrain exploration and search and rescue operations. This chapter presents study results associated with real-time trajectory planning and cooperative formation flying algorithms for use in performing multi-UAV cooperative operations. Closed form analytical and simulation results were used along with a UAS simulation test bed for evaluating and verifying these algorithms in multi-UAV cooperative scenarios. The full kinematics constraints of the UAV model is explicitly used, ensuring the planned trajectories and formations are feasible. Two operational modes are implemented for every UAV, one corresponding to the search phase, the other corresponding to the cooperative flying phase. Each phase is executed upon receiving commands. Finally this chapter discusses the use of this simulation environment for multi-UAV cooperative operator training. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {with the advances in wireless ad hoc communications, robotics and microflyer technology it will be possible to organize clusters (teams) of small unmanned ground, sea and airborne vehicles and to launch complex missions that comprise several such teams. Possible applications include: coordinated aerial sweep of vast urbanhuburban areas to track suspects, search and rescue operations in areas unf?iendly to humans (e.g., chemical spills, terrorist attacks, etc), exploration of remote planets, reconnaissance of enemy field in the battle theater, etc. The success of the mission will require efficient, reliable, low latency communications within members of each team, across teams and to a manned command post. In this paper, we focus on a particular aspect of mission oriented communications, namely, team multicast. In team multicast the multicast group does not consist of individual members, rather, of teams. For example, the teams may consist of special task forces that have been established to launch a search and rescue mission. We identi@ the multicast communications requirements of teams and swarms, and then propose an approach to support such requirements in a large scale. heterogeneous, highly mobile network. Simulation results illustrate the performance benefits of the team multicast solution as compared with more traditional multicast approaches. © 2003 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Parallel hybrid-electric propulsion systems would be beneficial for small unmanned aerial vehicles used for military, homeland security, and disaster-monitoring missions involving intelligence, surveillance, or reconnaissance (ISR). The benefits include increased time on station and range as compared to electric-powered unmanned aerial vehicles and reduced acoustic and thermal signatures not available with gasoline-powered unmanned aerial vehicles. A conceptual design of a small unmanned aerial vehicle with a parallel hybrid-electric propulsion system, the application of a rule-based controller to the hybrid-electric system, and simulation results are provided. The two-point conceptual design includes an internal combustion engine sized for cruise speed and an electric motor and lithium-ion battery pack sized for endurance speed. A rule-based controller based on ideal operating line concepts is applied to the control of the parallel hybrid-electric propulsion system. The energy use for the 13.6 kg (30 lb) hybrid-electric unmanned aerial vehicle with the rule-based controller during one-hour and three-hour ISR missions is 54% and 22% less, respectively, than for a four-stroke gasoline-powered unmanned aerial vehicle.

	abstract = {A new approach was proposed to locate ground target with unmanned aerial vehicle. The new approach computed the three-dimension coordinates of ground target according to the pose angles of carrier, pose angles of the stabilization platform of the optical axis, and the ranging data from laser ranger. The shortcomings of collinearity equations were overcome based methods which were not robust to terrain. The divergence of DEM iteration was avoided. Mathematical model for precision analysis was formulated to evaluate the performance of the presented approach. A simulation example was given to test the effectiveness of the method. The simulation result shows that the location accuracy can satisfy the needs of combat with ship-borne guns.},

	abstract = {In recent years, because of the emerging requirements for increasing autonomy, the controller of uninhabited air vehicles must be augmented with a very sophisticated autopilot design which is capable of tracking complex and agile maneuvering trajectory. This paper provides a simplified control system framework to solve UAV maneuvering trajectory tracking problem. The flight control system is divided into three subsystems including command generation, transformation and allocation. According to the kinematics equations of the aircraft, flight path angle commands can be generated by desired 3D position from path planning. These commands are transformed to body angular rates through direct nonlinear mapping, which is simpler than common multi-loop method based on time scale separation assumption. Then, by using weighted pseudo-inverse method, the control surface deflections are allocated to follow body angular rates from the previous step. In order to improve the robustness, a nonlinear disturbance observer-based approach is used to compensate the uncertainty of system. A 6DOF nonlinear UAV model is controlled to demonstrate the performance of the trajectory tracking control system. Simulation results show that the control strategy is easy to be realized and the precision of tracking is satisfying.},

	abstract = {Search and rescue missions can be efficiently and automatically performed by small, highly maneuverable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teams. The search problem is complicated by a lack of prior information, nonlinear mapping between sensor observations and the physical world, and potentially non-Gaussian sensor noise models. To address these problems, a distributed control algorithm is proposed, using information theoretic methods with particle filters, to compute optimal control inputs for a multi-vehicle, coordinated localization of a stationary target. This technique exploits the structure of the probability distributions of the target state and of the sensor measurements to compute the control inputs that maneuver the UAVs to make observations that minimize the expected future uncertainty of the target state. Because the method directly uses the particle filter state and an accurate sensor noise model to compute the mutual information, it is no longer necessary to discard information by using linear and Gaussian approximations. To ensure safety of the vehicles, the algorithm incorporates collision avoidance and control authority constraints. The resulting information theoretic cost calculation is coupled amongst the vehicles and becomes prohibitive as the size of the UAV team becomes large. Therefore, single vehicle and pairwise approximations to the cost function are used that greatly reduce the computational burden and allow for development of a distributed algorithm for real-time optimization of vehicle trajectories. Simulation results are shown for a bearings-only sensor model with multiple vehicles. Initial flight tests of the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC) show the feasibility of impleentation of this algorithm on the quadrotor testbed and in real world situations.},
